# Culhwch
· "Cilydd suggests that Culhwch go to visit Arthur, ostensibly to get his hair cut: this presumably represents a rite of passage from youth to manhood."
· Culhwch...is given a series of 'impossible' tasks - reminiscent of the Labours of Hercules - which he must accomplish to win Olwen."
		○ "...the retrieval of the scissors, razor and comb from between the ears of one Twrch Trwyth, a huge, destructive boar who was one a king and who, together with his followers, has been transformed by God as a punishment for his evil ways. Thus we meet the concept of transmogrification being imposed upon wrong-doers."
· "As Culhwch reaches Arthur's court, his superhuman, godlike rank is revealed: the keeper of the gate refuses the unannounced Culhwch entry; the hero responds by threatening to utter three shouts that will make women barren and cause those who are pregnant to abort. The threat of barrenness probably symbolizes Culhwch's ability to make Arthur's crops and herds infertile as well."
