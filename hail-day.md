<pre>
Sigrdrífa tok þa horn fult miaþar  Sigrdrífa took a horn full of mead
ok gaf hanom minnisveig.           and gave him the ritual-dreak

Heill dagr!                        Hail Day!
Heilir dags synir!                 Hail Day's Sons!
Heil nótt ok nipt!                 Hail Night and her nipt!
Óreiðum augum                      Look on the two of us here
lítið okkr þinig                   with friendly eyes
ok gefið sitjǫndum sigr.           and give us victory.
<br>
Heilir æsir!                       Hail the Gods!
Heilar ásynjur!                    Hail the Goddesses!
Heil sjá in fjǫlnyta fold!         Hail the Hospitable Earth!
Mál, ok mannvit                    Give the two of us
gefið okkr mærum tveim--           eloquent speech
ok læknishendr, meðan lifum.       and healing hands, all our life.
