# Our Betrayal


### Sky Father
Dyeus Pater *peh₂- which originally meant “to protect” and later “to shepherd” (*peh₂nts?). It also gave birth to the term *ph₂tḗr (“father” literally “protector”).
We once had a Heavenly Shepherd. Our true father. And we betrayed him for yahweh.

### Mithra (mitra "friend")
He was the only IE go to have once been worshipped from England to India. But we chose Christ, and betrayed our friend.
