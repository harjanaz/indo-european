The purpose of this talk is to clarify some of the basic premises of the so-called ‘ontological turn’ in recent anthropological theory. Presenting briefly two examples of ethnographic analysis that demonstrate some of the basic characteristics of this approach, I suggest that the ontological turn must be understood as a strictly methodological proposal, and above all as a technique of anthropological description. Thus understood, the ontological turn involves deepening and radicalizing three features that have always been present in mainstream anthropological research, namely reflexivity, conceptualization and experimentation.
