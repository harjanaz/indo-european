## Option 1: Just send me your notes!
`erickjdodge (at) outlook.com`
Word doc, pdf, whatever. Just email them to me and I'll add them. If you happen to write notes using markdown (i.e. `filename.md`) I would prefer you to use wikilinks instead of regular markdown links (i.e. `[[page]]` not `[page](page.md)`).

## Option 2: GitHub
1. Make a Github account
2. Email me: `erickjdodge (at) outlook.com` and tell me your github account name. I'll then add you as a collaborator.
3. Get the Github for desktop app
4. Clone the repo
5. Download ObsidianMD app
6. Open the repo with Obsidian and edit away 
7. Commit and Push your changes

Next time you want to edit it:
1. Open Github desktop app: Fetch origin, pull origin
3. Open ObsidianMD: edit away
4. Open Github desktop app: Commit and push changes
