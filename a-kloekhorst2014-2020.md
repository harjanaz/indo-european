> Mobile App. VanVoices (i.e. "Vanished Voices: The Indo-European Phrase Book App") is part of the research project ['Splitting the Mother Tongue'](http://www.kloekhorst.nl/SplittingTheMotherTongue.html). The app integrates the Indo-Anatolian model, according to which the Anatolian branch was a sister language of PIE rather than a daughter language, both going back to an even earlier proto-language called Proto-Indo-Anatolian.
