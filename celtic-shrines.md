# *Celtic Shrines*

Not formalized, usually open-air enclosures, lakes or springs

There are few stone or metal images of the gods (although the chance preservation of wooden objects leads us to believe that these may have been relatively common.)

***The culvert of the sacred baths of Sulis at Bath***

- A Romano-Celtic pewter mask, perhaps nailed onto the door of a shrine

***Gournay (Oise) in France, was the site of an oppidum (urban settlement) of the Bellovaci. 3rd century BC***

- Central pit contained the sacrificed bodies of elderly oxen for decomposition before the bones were carefully positioned in the ditch surrounding the precinct.Â  Young pigs and lambs were slaughtered and consumed in religious feasting; 2000 ritually-broken weapons.

***Hayling Island, Hampshire. 1st century BC, late Iron Age***

- A circular timber building surrounded by a courtyard. 'Ritually killed weapons' and the remains of animals, with cattle deliberately avoided (perhaps due to a local taboo).

***South Cadbury hillfort in Somerset***

- A rectangular porched shrine. An avenue of young-animal-burials led to it.

***Navan (Co. Armagh), Ireland***

- A great round structure. A huge central post (felled: 95/94 BC). Soon after it was built the structure was deliberately burned down and sealed beneath a great stone cairn.

***R-C shrine at Caerwent, South Wales***

- Stone severed head

***Deal, Kent, 2nd century AD***

- May have been an underground shrine deep in a ritual pit

- Chalk figurine of a "chthonic deity"
