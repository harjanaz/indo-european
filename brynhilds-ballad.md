# Ballad of Brynhild


http://www.odins-gift.com/pclass/brynhildsballad.htm

I have heard a rhyme,
written on green slopes,
this was early in ancient time,
in the days of Buðli.

Refrain:
Grani brought gold from the heath,
he hew his sword in rage,
Sigurd slew the serpent,
Grani brought gold from the heath.

In ancient times there was a king
Buðli was his name,
he had such a beautiful daughter,
born for a good faith.

The king rules over a long grove,
they called him Buðli the bright,
the chieftain shares his gold and rings
with his fighting men.

His only daughter’s name was known
over the green slopes,
her name was Brynhild Buðladaughter,
the beautiful spouse.

His only daughter’s name was known
over the green groves,
her name was Brynhild Buðladaughter,
the beautiful maid.

Brynhild dwelled on Hildar-mountain,
she is Buðli’s daughter,
it was claimed in “Bragdar-táttur”,
her shadow fell on light.

Brynhild lived on Hildar-mountain,
amidst her fathers realm,
the light shone from her shoulder-branch,
it was like watching fire.

Brynhild sits down in her chair,
combing her fine hair,
it is like the finest silk,
with a golden hue.

Brynhild resides in the hall,
sought by mighty men,
Buðli’s daughter don’t consider
anyone her match.

She was wooed by many men,
sons of kings and earls,
Brynhild was so suitor-shy,
she turned turned down all and one.

It was that almighty king,
he wrapped himself in skins,
he went to the high loft
to see his daughter there.

”Listen to me, daughter dear,
I worry about you,
your’e rejecting every man,
asking for your hand.

How long will you, daughter dear,
cause me all this pain,
you are rejecting every man,
visiting this castle?”

”Hush up, hush up father dear,
do not speak like that,
the mighty lord that suits my rank
has not arrived just yet.

The mighty lord that suits my rank,
has not arrived just yet,
my yearnings and my longings go
eastwards of the lands.

Sigurd is he called by name,
he is son of Sigmund,
it was the young Hjørdís
who brought him to this world.”

”It seems a bit peculiar,
the way you turn your love,
to desire a foreign man
that you have never seen.”

”The norns have put me up to this,
placed cravings in my chest,
for nine winters I yearned for Sigurd,
whom I’ve never seen.”

The king replied and answered this,
he sipped on the pure mead:
”What makes this Sigurd better
than my other swains?

Listen to me, daughter dear,
listen what I ask:
what makes this Sigurd better
than my other men?”

”This makes Sigurd better
than any other man:
because he kills the heathens
one hundred at the time.

This makes Sigurd better
than any other hero,
his saddle and his iron-shirt
glint like bright gold.
23.
I have heard the tales and stories
of his deed and slyness
when he by his mighty sword
killed the “Fraenar-serpent”.

I have heard the tales and stories,
I wasn’t there myself,
when he slayed the “Fraenar-serpent”,
on the Glitra-heath.

When he slayed the “Fraenar-serpent”,
on the Glitra-heath,
that’s how Sigurd could acquire
loads and loads of gold.

Sjúrður slayed the “Fraenar-serpent”
that’s why he is so rich,
no other man on Húna-land
do match up with him.”

”Listen to me, daughter dear,,
please do tell me this:
how we make this mighty man
to come here from his lands?”

”In the desert wilderness
you shall raise a hall,
I shall stay inside of it
with only a few hands.

You shall place my golden chair
in the great outdoors,
the best of which the two dwarf-smiths
can create with their runes.

The best of which the two dwarf-smiths
can create with their runes,
both with smoke and fiery-fire,
burning all around.

Let this raging fiery-fire,
be my guard and shelter,
no one except Sigurd the brave
dares to cross that flame.

Then he built that mighty hall,
in the great outdoors
and with only a few hands,
she moved in there to stay.

Then he built that mighty hall
in the wilderness,
both with smoke and fiery flames,
burning all around.

And such a mighty fiery fire
he planted all around,
the best of which the two dwarfs
could create with runes.

And such a mighty fiery fire
was planted all around,
so the dwarf-smiths could not reach
her with their deceit.

Early in the morning hour
the sun shines red on mountains,
hords of noblemen are riding
to king Buðli’s hall.

Early in the morning hour
the sun reach the horizon,
hords of noblemen are riding
to king Buðli’s court.

Hords of noblemen are riding
to king Buðli’s court,
Brynhild resides in her chair,
her eyebrows shine like gold.

Buðli enters the audience,
calls on the lady to answer:
”King Gunnar has just arrived
up here from Júkagard.

Listen, Brynhild, daughter dear,
this is what you shall do:
King Gunnar has just arrived,
you have to accept his hand.”

Buðli stands there on the floor,
leaning on the table,
but young Brynhild, his own daughter,
doesn’t speak a word.

Brynhild stood up from the chair,
flashing red and golden,
hastened away from Buðli’s castle,
and enters Hildar-hill.

Grím and Högni Júkason,
clashed on the green field,
up jumped maids on Hildar-hill
(high) Buðli’s hall was shaking.

Grím and Högni Júkason,
fought with sharpened swords,
Brynhild stays in fiery-flames
in the midst of her fathers realm.

She sits down on the golden chair,
she smiles behind her linen:
”He who dares to cross the fire,
he shall soon be mine.

Brynhild sits in golden chair,
that beautiful young maid,
allures now Sigurd from his lands,
to her own misfortune.

Sigurd wakes up an early morning,
he tells about his dream,
he was just as alerted as
the stream of a running river.

”I dreamt that Grani
stood in fierce, red flames,
in front of him, on the green field,
streams of blood were pouring.

I dreamt, I sat on Grani’s back,
I drove him all I could,
in front of him, on the green field,
human blood was streaming.

I dreamt my saddle girth did break,
my gold and heavy belt,
I dreamt about my precious sword,
cracking a golden helmet.”

Sigurd dressed in the early morning,
he performs his praise,
then he went out in the garden,
where he made out things.

He was told by the fabulous birds,
residing in the grove:
”Fair is Brynhild Buðladaughter
she yearns for your encounter!”

He was told by the wild birds,
residing in the oak:
”Fair is Brynhild Buðladaughter
she’s waiting for your move!”

This is how Sigurd heard
east in (his own) land:
”Brynhild lives on Hildarmountain,
she is shy of suitors.”

Early in the morning hour
the sun was shining wide,
he calls on Víggrím Gunnarsson:
”Saddle my fair horse!”

They lead out the mighty steed,
which Sigurd wanted to ride
he was covered with scarlet housing
down on half his height.

They lead out the mighty steed
to the wall of the hall,
he was covered with scarlet housing
down to his fetlock.

He took his golden gauntlets
put them on his hands,
then young Sigurd rode away
the straight ward down the road.

Then rode Sigurd Sigmundsson,
straight ward on his way,
the golden rings were tinkling,
his good steed bounded on.

He brought with him on the trip
twelve bright golden rings,
and the red Queen’s ring
on top of them all.

He brought with him twelve golden rings
and put them on his arm,
then that handsome boy rides out,
bound for Buðli’s land.

Grani gallops just as well
on rocky ground as mead
no one ever came like that
to King Buðli’s hall.

Grani gallops just as well
on rocky ground as sand,
no one ever came like that
to King Buðli’s land.

He rode down the low road
and passed the Júkagard,
Grimhild stood outside the farm
with a herd of men

Grimhild stood outside the farm
with so many men,
she used both her hands to grab
for the horse’s rein.

She used both her hands to grab
for the horse’s rein
all because she never saw
such a handsome man before.

Then spoke Sigurd Sigmundsson,
his face looked brave and bold:
”I have never known a woman
who dared to stop my steed.”

”Sigurd, let your journey rest
and speak with me awhile,
I have a daughter, fair and pretty
who’d like to be your lover.”

”I won’t let my journey rest,
my steed is running on,
I am riding to the hill
of the fiery fire.

I won’t let my journey rest,
my steed fares through the grove,
I am riding to the hill,
to see the beautiful maid.”

Nowadays, jus as before,
suitors ride to woe,
no one dared to pass the point
where they saw the fire.

The standard-bearer spoke like this,
he urges with these words:
”He who dares to cross the fire,
he shall have the maid.”

Grímur rides out on green meadow,
brave and bold his face,
but he had to stop his horse,
before it jumped the fire.

Then brave Sigurd spoke like this,
(his words are still remembered):
”I bear the signings on my shield,
that I shall cross the fire.”

No one but brave Sigurd
entered Hildar-hill,
he jumped through smoke and fiery-fire,
he and his horse, Grani.

Grani made his take-off
firmly from the ground,
He was close to the hill-gates
when his hoofs touched down.

Grani made his take-off
brave and without fear,
the fiery flames were burning
over Sigurd’s loin.

Sigurd entered Brynhild’s hill,
which no one dared before,
he took out his mighty sword
and cleaved the hill-gates down.

And with this, his mighty sword,
he broke the wickets down,
then he saw the fair maid lying
in her coat of arms.*

Then brave Sigurd went inside,
he took a look around,
there he saw the fair maid lying
all alone in bed.

There he saw that pretty maid
sleeping in her mail,
raised his good and sharpened sword,
and cut the mail wide open.

Up woke Brynhild Buðledaughter,
surprised, and looked around:
”Who did own that sharpened sword
that just cut of my mail?”

Up woke Brynhild Buðledaughter
took a look around:
”Who are you, brave swain,
who just cut of my mail?”

”You shall call me Sigurd,
I am son of Sigmund,
it was young Hjørdís,
who brought me in this world.

I rode from countries far away
just to visit you,
I am Sigurd Sigmundsson,
my dear and precious one.”

Brynhild sat up in her bed,
she smiled behind her linnen:
”Welcome to this place of mine
from countries far away.

Listen Sigurd Sigmundsson,
who showed you the way,
through the smoke and fiery fire,
to this place of mine?”

”I was told by two wild birds,
through the greenish grove:
Fair is Brynhild Buðledaughter,
she yearns for your encounter.

I was told by wild birds,
back in my own place:
Fair is Brynhild Buðledaughter.
then I rode up here.”

”Listen Sigurd Sigmundsson,
do not act to fast,
you shold see my father first
and ask for his permission.”

Sigurd spoke and answered this,
fair he was, and wise:
”You are not exactly known
to take your fathers advice.

Brynhild, for a while you have
tried to get me here,
I don’t want to meet your father
or get his permission.”

There and then he made love
to that mighty maid,
Ásla Sigurdsdaughter was
conceived at just that moment.

He put his arms, kind and gently
under Brynhild’s neck,
I do swear on my very faith,
he didn’t plan to betray her.

He took out twelve golden rings
and placed them on her knee:
”This shall be the first and foremost
token of our love.”

He took out twelve golden rings
and placed them on her knee
On top of that he placed
the precious ring of Queens.

He took out twelve golden rings
and put them on her arm:
”This shall be the second
token of our love.”

It was Sigurd Sigmundsson,
he didn’t need no riches,
he tied up three golden rings
into Brynhild’s plait.

It was Sigurd Sigmundsson,
the bold one and the brave,
he stayed in that lady’s bower
for seven months.

”Brynhild, bring my halter and saddle,
ring and kneelong mail,
I have to ride out for a while
to run a little errand.”

”Why don’t you just stay right here,
and play a game of chess,
King Júki has a daughter,
her magic is to strong.

You are very young of age,
your life lessons are few,
you will fall in Guðrun’s power,
and won’t return to me.”

”That’s a stupid thing to say,
that will never happen,
Brynhild, I will never ever
turn my love from you.”

Brynhild Buðledaughter spoke,
her heart began to cool:
”Júki’s daughter will seduce
you with er sweet love.

Listen Sigurd Sigmundsson,
I’ll give you finger gold,
do not ride to Grimhild,
because her play is foul.”

She walked him on the way,
bade him to fare well:
”Have a good and happy journey,
I hope all things go well.”

It was Brynhild Buðledaughter,
wished him a peaceful trip:
”Have a good and happy journey,
I hope all things go well.

Happy and in best of spirits,
we shall part right here,
remember Sigurd, what I told you,
keep my words in mind.”

Sigurd did reply to that,
the brave and handsome boy:
”You will never, my beloved,
ever leave my mind.”

It was Sigurd Sigmundsson,
holding on the pommel,
he kissed lady Brynhild,
firmly and with joy.

It was Sigurd Sigmundsson,
he rode into the court,
no one less than King Buðle,
awaited him outside.

”Welcome Sigurd Sigmundsson,
here to my estate,
drink whatever you prefer
of my mead or wine.”

”I don’t care about your mead,
even less of wine,
give to me young Brynhild,
your beloved daughter.”

”Welcome Sigurd Sigmundsson,
you don’t need to ask,
I know all about your faith,
and how it all will end.

You are very young of age,
your life lessons are few,
you will fall for Guðrun’s hands,
and won’t enjoy young Brynhild.

Though you promised Brynhild true,
you won’t keep your word,
Guðrun makes a death-mens drink,
which will cause you pain.

”That’s a stupid thing to say,
that will never happen,
I will never turn my love
from your daughter Brynhild.”

Then king Buðli spoke like this,
his heart began to cool:
”Júki’s daughter will seduce
you with her sweet love.”

”That’s a stupid thing to say,
it will never happen,
that I shall ever turn my love
from your daughter Brynhild.”

”Listen Sigurd Sigmundsson,
don’t bring the shame on you,
do not take the low-road
that leads to Júkagard.

Do not take the low-road
that leads to Júkagard,
Grimhild will await you
with a herd of men.

Grimhild will await you,
with a herd of men,
she would like to ask you,
to where you are bound.

She would like to ask you
to where you are bound,
she has never seen such
handsome man on horse.”

He walked him on the way,
bade him to fare well:
”Have a good and happy journey,
I hope all things go well.”

Sigurd rode into the woods,
anticipates no danger,
there he saw the savage beast
tumble on both sides,

There he saw the savage beast,
tumble on both sides,
spewing fire, puking venom,
he was in mortal danger.

Sigurd sat on Grani’s back,
he couldn’t find his way,
Grani was so horrified,
he stared to both his sides.

She scared his horse out of his wits,
he couldn’t find his way,
then Sigurd had to turn around
and ride to Júkagard.

The savage beast then disappeared,
out of Sigurd’s sight,
then he saw where Grimhild sat,
tied up in two ropes.

He rode down the low-road,
that leads to Júkagard,
there was Grimhild waiting for him
with a herd of men.

There was Grimhild waiting for him
with a herd of men,
she used both her hands to grab
for the horse’s rein.

”Sigurd, let your journey rest
and speak with me awhile,
I have a daughter, fair and pretty
who’d like to be your lover.”

Fair is Guðrun, my own daughter,
everywhere she walks,
roses and those lillies
are shining from her cheek.

Fair is Guðrun, my own daughter,
wherever she walks in,
she doesn’t look like Brynhild more
than summer looks like winther.

Please do step inside the hall
and rest there for a while,
drink from that expensive mug,
your steed is put in stable.”

Out stepped lady Guðrun,
wearing her blue dress,
plaited hair on shoulders,
with tiny silky ropes.

It was Grimhild, Júke’s queen,
she orders her own daughter:
”Go down to the cellar,
and mix up mead and wine.

Go down to the cellar,
and mix up mead and wine,
then blend some amnesia
up into the drink.”

Guðrun Júkadaughter said,
her voice seemed quite incensed:
”Craving men from other women,
that can not be right.

In our countries there are many
sons of kings and earls,
desiring other women’s men,
that can not be right.”

Grimhild rose her right hand,
and hit on her mouth,
blood was dripping down her chest,
watched by many men.

”Shut up, Guðrun, my own daughter,
the shy ones never win,
it is better to ask yourself,
than loosing a good man.”

Guðrun went down to the cellar,
mixed up mead and wine,
blended some amnesia
up into the drink.

Blendet some amnesia
up into the drink,
brought it up to Sigurd
and asked him for a toast.

Sigurd drank that precious drink,
drank out from that horn,
there he lost his memory,
and he could not be cured.

Then he drank that precious drink,
drank from that bright horn,
Sigurd lost his memory
and bride from Buðlungs heart.

And when he had finished up,
he gave her back the mug,
he did not remember Brynhild,
or even where he was.

Guðrun made a toast herself
to that mighty swain,
the only thing on Sigurd’s mind
was to get to her.

It was lady Grimhild,
she told her daughter this:
”Go in to the bedroom
and make a bed for him.”

It was Sigurd Sigmundsson,
he took himself a wife,
held the wedding instantly,
he didn’t want to wait.

They celebrated on their wedding,
merrily and happy,
then they went to the same bed
Sigurd and his wife.

Fifty candlelight were burning
on those fairy meadows,
the king and the entire herd
showed them to the bed.

Sigurd went into the bedroom,
found his way to Guðrun,
Brynhild on the Hildar-hill,
heard it, and grew angry.

Brynhild left the Hildar-hill,
that beautiful young wife,
the hero lived with Guðrun,
but Sigurd lost his life.

Brynhild spoke and uttered this,
teardrops on her cheek:
”Guðrun Júkadaughter shall
never keep that man.”

Brynhild spoke and uttered this,
in her darkest hour:
”Taking other womens men,
that is doomed to failure.

Early in the morning hour,
redness before sunrise,
went to waterfront to bath,
both the maids were fair.

Early in the morning hour,
sun shines on the slopes,
went to waterfront to bath,
both the wives were fair.

They met on the half-way
Brynhild and Júki’s Guðrun,
one of them was happy
the other sick with grief.

They met on the half-way,
Brynhild and young Guðrun,
one of them was happy,
the other bent with sorrow.

Brynhild didn’t say a word,
the saucy Guðrun uttered:
”Why don’t my brother Gunnar,
take a fair maid like you?”

It was Guðrun Júkadaughter,
her act was often rash,
she didn’t want to use the water,
that streamed through Brynhild’s hair.

She went in the river,
where the flood was strong,
all because her husband rode
higher than the rest.

Guðrun jumped into the stream,
where the flood was strong,
because her husband held his head
higher than the rest.

”I recieved this golden ring,
that I wear on my arm,
from that Sigurd Sigmundsson,
whom I took from you.”

Brynhild Buðladaughter answered,
struggling with her anger:
”For those words shall Sigurd die,
if I live to tell.

You did win that mighty hero
all against my will,
I made love with Sigurd swain,
before you even saw him.”

”You lost your virginity,
and Buðli lost his honour,
you gave yourself to a mighty king,
whom I now possess.”

”Listen to me, shameless tart,
don’t suggest my shame,
for those words shall Sigurd die,
if I live to tell.”

”I am not afraid of you,
although your words are rash,
nobody in Júkagard,
could threathen Sigurd’s life.”

Brynhild went home grieving,
to her hall to stay,
bright and brave king Gunnar
went to visit her.

Brynhild went into her bower,
right into her bed,
there she moaned for a while,
Sigurd’s broken promise.

This heard Sigurd Sigmundsson
right at that same hour,
went himself to visit her,
that attractive maid.

”Not even the most boorish knight,
would behave like you,
you betrayed the maiden,
whom you promised true.”

”Listen, my own darling,
don’t blame me for all this,
my mind was turned away from you,
and this love of yours.”

At the moment Brynhild saw
Sigurd with her eyes,
she went into labour,
and bore a little girl.

Brynhild said and uttered this,
as soon as she was done:
”Place my child out in the river,
I do not want to see it.”

They took Ásla Sigurdsdaughter,
put her in the river,
mighty streams and torrent floods
brought her from the lands.

Many men have been at risk,
caused by pretty wives,
now we reach that fatal hour,
when Sigurd lost his life.

Sigurd was a mighty man,
his sword was drenched in blood,
his death was caused by jealous women,
as you soon shall learn.

Brynhild resides in her hall
grieving and in pain,
she could neither spear or rest,
she that fairest maid.

Gunnar went into the hall,
sharpened sword in sheath:
”Whoever caused you all this pain,
shall suffer brutal death.”

”It was Guðrun, your own sister,
she caused me this pain,
she now owns that Sigurd swain,
who rides above all men.”

Brynhild lay down in her bed,
Gunnar stood beside,
there they planned the evil deed,
a woman’s pride is cold.

”You shall never have my love,
don´t expect affection,
before you’ve brought young Sigurd
from his life on earth.”

”Listen, oh my darling one,
I won’t believe my ears,
do you want to harm and hurt
young Sigurd with deceit?

Gunnar spoke and uttered this:
”This is how it is:
Sigurd is my blood-brother,
I can never harm him.”

”You shall never have my love,
neither my affection,
as long as Sigurd is alive,
my anger won’t wear off.”

”Listen, oh my darling one,
you bring me into danger,
how can I cause Sigurd’s death,
he can’t be killed by swords?

Thus said Høgni Júkason,
his cheeks were turning pale:
”Fifteen winters may have passed,
since we held a fight.”

Brynhild sits in golden chair,
so the story tells,
now the Júkungs plan to ride
out into the forest.

Brynhild sits in her own chair,
plays a golden knife:
”Don’t come back in to my hall,
while Sigurd is alive.”

”Listen Brynhild Buðledaughter,
you have to tell us this,
how are we going to put
young Sigurd to his death?”

”You have to give him salted food,
but don’t give him a drink,
then take a ride out in the forest
safe and without fear.

You ask him to shift saddle,
you ask him to change horse,
be deceitful in your heart,
do the best you can.”

Sigurd walks into the hall,
fair he is and wise,
where she, Brynhild Buðledaughter
resides in her chair.

He stands before her on the floor,
holds a golden shield,
but young Brynhild Buðledaughter,
she turns her eyes away.

Sigurd speaks and utter this,
he is a brave man:
”When I return back from the forest,
I’ll commit to you.”

Brynhild answered him like this,
her voice was shrill and strident:
”I won’t commit to two kings
both in the same hall.”

Brynhild Buðladaughter answered,
her heart was filled with grief:
”Listen Sigurd Sigmundsson,
you won’t commit to me.”

There was rumble in Buðli’s hall,
swains prepare to ride,
Brynhild stays in golden chair,
tears fell from her eyes.

King Buðli spoke and uttered this,
sadly, and in grief:
”Bring to Sigurd sword and helmet
and a hunter’s horn.”

No one wishes harm on others,
to see a close one out,
soon shall Sigurd Sigmundsson,
loose his life on earth.

King Buðli spoke and uttered this,
he handles his red ring:
”Listen Brynhild, daughter dear,
why do you cause his death?

Do you, Brynhild, daughter dear,
recollect those days,
when you allured young Sigurd,
from Northlands, through green slopes.

Do you, Brynhild, daughter dear,
recollect those days,
when you allured young Sigurd,
to come to Hildar-hill?”

King Buðle leaves the ladie’s bower,
this early morning hour,
leaving behind Brynhild
with chin upon her hand.

They rode into the forest,
Sigurd in their midst,
he didn’t realize the treason,
they had in their minds.

Brynhild stands inside the hall,
she sees far and wide,
brave Sigurd rides in front
of the Júkabrothers.

Brynhild rests in golden chair,
grieving and in pain,
shed so many teardrops
down on her own arms.

Brynhild cries in desperation,
she that fairest wife:
”Goodbye Sigurd Sigmundsson,
I won’t see you alive.”

They ride in the forest,
brave and without fears,
they gave Sigurd salted food,
but not a single drink.

They drank from their hunting-horns,
many times and often,
but Sigurd’s horn was left behind
back on Júke’s loft.

They drank from their hunting-horns,
brave and without fear,
Sigurd sits on Grane’s back,
he is very thirsty.

They drank from their hunting-horns,
brave and without worries,
Sigurd loosens his helm-band,
and jumps down from the saddle.

He stepped down from his saddle,
suspected no deceit,
hastened to the fountain,
brave and without fear.

Sigurd kneeled to drink
the water from the well,
but seldom grows a good twig
from an evil bush.

Sigurd kneeled to drink
the water from the brook,
Gunnar owned the sword-blade
which bit him in the neck.

Høgni thrusted, Gunnar hewed,
with their sharpened swords,
it was an act of villainy
they took young Sigurd’s life.

Høgni thrusted, Gunnar hewed,
they followed Brynhild’s order,
if he knew about the treason,
he would have killed them both.

Sigurd’s tongue began to talk,
angry and in rage:
”If I knew about your treason,
I could have killed you both.”

Sigurd’s tongue began to talk,
he lay there on the lawn:
”If I knew about your treason,
I could have killed you all.”

There they changed their garments,
each with his own hue,
Grani wouldn’t take a step,
he had the wit of men.

Grani wouldn’t take a step,
with Gunnar on his back,
not before brave Sigurd,
were put up on his back.

They took the corpse of Sigurd,
brought him home on shields,
many a man has lost his life,
because of female pride.

They took the corpse of Sigurd,
placed him in Guðruns bed,
the bride was unaware until
she woke in bloodstained sheets.

The bride was uaware until
she woke in bloodstained sheets,
no wonder that young Guðrun,
watched the sight in chock.

Guðrun Júkadaughter woke up,
uttered this and said:
”King Gunnar, I had never tought
that you were such a traitor.”

Guðrun sat up in the bed,
stroke the blood away,
she kissed the bloody mouth
on Sigurds head.

It was Guðrun Júkadaughter,
uttered this and said:
”I shall avenge young Sigurd’s death,
if I live to tell.”

Guðrun stepped out on the loft,
she stripped from her red dress,
the rest of her lifetime,
she mourned Sigurd’s death.

”Listen to me, daughter dear,
don’t grief for Sigurd’s death,
king Artala from Hunland
has lots of gold and riches.”

Guðrun Júkadaughter answered,
grieving and in pain:
”Still I shall avenge Sigurd’s death,
if I live to tell.”

For many nights, Brynhild had
slept in Sigurd’s arms,
now when she had caused his death,
she died of a broken heart.

Brynhild died from a broken hearth,
Sigurd lost his life,
it was clear, that through her love,
Brynhild now was free.

Brynhild died from a broken heart
after Sigurd’s death,
they brought to Guðrun gold and riches
and many golden rings.

There is a truth in what they say,
a woman’s heart is tender,
Guðrun walks all over the world,
holding Grani’s rein.

Now it’s time to end this song,
the chanting has to stop,
now we’ll start the third ballad
for all of us to learn.
