# Celtic Mistletoe
The Curing of Barrenness:
	[Pliny] "On the sixth day of the moon the druids climbed a sacred oak and cut off a mistletoe bough using a 'golden' (probably gilded bronze) sickle, catching the branch in a white cloak. Two white bulls were then sacrificed. When mixed in a potion, it was believed to cure infertility.
