[[sacred-sites]]
Over 400 in Estonia, in settled areas, not far from farms and villages

Sacred
Function: Healing, Offering
Material: Natural granite boulders, without any specific features (small number of exceptions: man made cup marks, 15-20 cm)
	In northern and western Estonia also some 10% of the stones with small cup-marks (diameter 5-8cm) from the Pre-Roman or Roman Iron Age…were used for offerings. However, it is likely that medieval practice was not based on continuity of tradition from the Iron Age but is of secondary origin.
