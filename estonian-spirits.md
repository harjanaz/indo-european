# Estonian Spirits
lower deities and fertility spirits had a great importance in popular religion until the second half of the nineteenth century

The luck of a household was connected with local spirits - these were worshipped in the form of dolls and images - and house snakes; both were provided with small gifts and offerings, mainly food.

nature spirits inhabiting forests, wilderness and water bodies - creatures almost untouched by Christian influences - existed.
