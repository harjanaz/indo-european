## Abstract
> `A series of parallels in the narrative structure, the ritual associations and the phraseology of the Norse myth of Brokk and the Sanskrit myth of Bhr̥gu allow for the assumption of a direct connection between these characters and call for a common etymology for both their names as reflexes of the same Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *(s)bʰr̥(h₂)g- ‘crackle, roar’. Old Norse (ON) Brokkr is the name of a mythical dwarf-smith who wins the head of the Norse fire-god Loki in a wager in the Skáldskaparmál (35), while Sanskrit (Skt.) Bhr̥gu- is the name of a seer who curses the Indian fire-god Agni to be sarvabhakṣa- ‘all-eating, all-devouring’ in the Mahābhārata (1.5–7; 9.46.12–20). Skt. Bhr̥gu- can hardly be kept apart from Vedic (Ved.) Bhŕ̥gu-, the name of a class of mythical beings who are constantly associated with fire in the Rigveda (RV). ON Brokkr and Ved. Bhŕ̥gu-, Skt. Bhr̥gu- may be traced back to *bʰr̥g-nó- (originally *bʰr̥h₂g-nó-) ‘crackling, roaring’ and *bʰŕ̥g-oṷ-/bʰr̥g-ṷ-´ ‘id.’ (originally *bʰŕ̥h₂g-oṷ-/bʰr̥h₂g-ṷ-´), respectively. These are derivatives of one and the same root, namely *bʰr̥(h₂)g- ‘crackle, roar’, which I interpret as the variant without s-mobile of the PIE root *spʰr̥h₂g- ‘crackle, roar’. The reconstruction of two derivatives, in -nó- (ON Brokkr) and in -u- (Ved. Bhŕ̥gu-), both meaning ‘crackling, roaring’, fits into the pattern of the Caland system which may be assumed for PIE *(s)bʰr̥(h₂)g- ‘crackle, roar’. Reflexes of *bʰr̥(h₂)g- and of *spʰr̥h₂g- allow to state further semantic and formal matches: - Gk. βαρυσφάραγος ‘with heavy roar’ and Ved. giribhráj- ‘heavy-roaring’ (collocation [HEAVY (*gʷerh₂-) – ROAR (*(s)bʰr̥(h₂)g-)]); - Gk. ἀνεμοσφάραγος ‘with roar of wind(s)’ and Ved. vā́tabhrajas- ‘with roaring of wind(s)’ (collocation [WIND – ROAR (*(s)bʰr̥(h₂)g-)]); - Hom. σφαραγέομαι ‘crackle, sizzle’, Ved. sphūrjáyant- ‘crackling, sizzling’ and bhūrjáyant- ‘id.’ (PIE *(s)bʰr̥h₂g-éi̯e- ‘crackle, sizzle’). This analysis finds support in the semantic associations of these characters and of the PIE root. ON Brokkr, Ved. Bhŕ̥gu- and the reflexes of PIE *(s)bʰr̥(h₂)g- ‘crackle, roar’ (such as Gk. σφαραγέομαι and Ved. sphūrjáyant-) seem to share an association with [FIRE], as shown by mythology, phraseology and ritual. Also, ON Brokkr and derivatives of PIE *(s)bʰr̥(h₂)g- (such as Gk. βαρυσφάραγος and Ved. vā́tabhrajas-) seem to share an association with [THUNDER], which, however, seems to be lacking for Ved. Bhŕ̥gu-.`
