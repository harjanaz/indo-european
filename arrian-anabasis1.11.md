> *Alexander...[arrived in Asia and]...slaughtered a bull as an offering to Poseidon and poured wine from a golden cup into the sea to propitiate the Nere√Øds. There is a further tradition that, fully armed, he was the first to leave the ship and set foot upon the soil of Asia, and that he built an altar on the spot where he left the shore of Europe and another where he landed on the other side of the strait, both of them dedicated to Zeus, the Lord of safe landings, Athena and Heracles. Once shore, he traveled inland to Troy and offered sacrifice to Athena, patron goddess of the city; here he made a gift of his armour to the temple, and took in exchange, from where they hung on the temple walls, some weapons which were still preserved from the Trojan War. These are supposed to have been carried before him by his bodyguard when he went into battle. He is also said to have offered sacrifice to Priam on the altar of Zeus Herceius, to avert his anger against the family of Neoptolemus whose blood still ran in his own veins.* [[arrian-anabasis]]
