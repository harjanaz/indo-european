Like the page [[ares-mars]], this page is for the deity, who to the Greeks was [[zeus]] and to the Romans [[jupiter]]. This page isn't for their common acestor or proto-form, but rather this page is for the historical product of imperial "interpretatio". Like how they would say "the Egyptian Mars", "the Nubian Ares", etc.



[[zeus]]
[[jupiter]]
