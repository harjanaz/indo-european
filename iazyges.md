- The Iazyges used [[horse tails]] in their religious rituals ([[preble1980]]p69).
- One of the Iazygian towns, [Bormanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bormanon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bormanon (page does not exist)"), is believed to have had [hot springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_spring "Hot spring") because settlement names starting with "Borm" were commonly used among European tribes to denote that the location had hot springs, which held religious importance for many Celtic tribes. It is not known, however, whether the religious significance of the hot springs was passed on to the Iazyges with the concept itself ([[dowden2013]]p45).
