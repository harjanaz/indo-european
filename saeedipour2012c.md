## Abstract
Some say that the scriptural Vedic Manu is the Noah of, or the Adam of, India. This interpretive comparison, whatever loose it may be demonstrated, is not appropriately explained and it is not logically approached. Multi-dimensional drama of Manu, who is the first mythical and mortal creature, the first mythical man or father of the Rig Veda's Aryans should mostly and contextually seem to be compared and paralleled with the homogeneously scriptural one, that is Avestan Gayomart or at last with Jam, Jamshid, the first king in Iranian 'mythical history'. The contextual and mythical points of similitude of the Rig Vedic 'Manu' and the Avestan 'Gayomart' and 'Jam' are verifiably recognizable, realizable, and positively understandable. Otherwise, the extent of discourse and logic of explanation would be diverted.
