The political acumen of Raedwald's queen recorded by Bede shows that England had a tradition of female guidance in matters of policy and belief which was active in early seventh century East Anglia. By the end of the seventh century, 'widowed queens and princesses became the religious specialists of the royal houses (Yorke). Women continued to influence the ideological posture of the English kingdom up to the 10th century reform, mainly through their sex-appeal according to Karkov.
