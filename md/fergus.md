# Fergus
§ "Ferghus...is cognate with the Latin vir (man) and he is associated with fertility imagery: he is the first lover of Queen Medb, herself notoriously promiscuous, and mate of the nature-goddess Flidais. [He has] a rampaging sexual appetite, requiring seven women to satisfy it."
§ "He has the strength of 700 men; he is as tall as a giant; and at one meal he can consume seven pigs, seven deer, seven cows and seven vats of liquor."
§ "He possesses a magic sword, long as a rainbow."
§ "[He] belongs to the court of King Conchobar of ulster...but a particular episode causes the defection of himself and other heroes to Medb's court."
§ "[He] is foster-father to...Cú Chulainn..."
§ "Some scholars are of the opinion that the Deirdre episode was added to the Táin specifically to explain Ferghus' defection."
§ "Some traditions credit Ferghus with authorship of the Táin."
