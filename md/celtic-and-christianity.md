# Celtic Conversion
Some of the earliest Christian geographies made use of prehistoric burial mounds (Knight, Meaney), referring to or claiming the existing ritual space. In Lincolnshire, a stretch of the River Witham used of votive deposits since the Bronze Age was given into the keeping of early monasteries which presided over continued votive deposition until the fourteenth century. 'Rather than destroying individual artefacts and structures belonging to the indigenous ideologies, the success of the Christian church in the seventh century lay in its concern to appropriate and 'convert' them to serve the causes of the new religion' (Stocker and Everson)…In the ninth-tenth century stone monuments were used as the boundary markers of the ecclesiastical estates in western Ireland (Ó Carragáin), in south-west Scotland (Crowe) and Cornwall (Turner)…In early Britain the inscribed stones of the fifth-seventh centuries may already have marked earlier territories or vistas yet to be defined. The stones were splendid with gilded letters and colored backgrounds, the inscriptions more iconic than literal (Okasha). Highlighting personal names of the famous dead, they were analogous to monumental tombs (Higgitt). In the seventh-ninth century, the new generation of ornamental stelae, 'many brightly colored with paint and inset with paint and inset with paste glass and metal', carried iconographic scenes which were rich in metaphor and learned allusions - 'sacraments in stone' celebrating a privileged link with God (Hawkes).
