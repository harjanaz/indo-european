# Diarmaid and Gráinne 
· "On their travels the couple enter the Forest of Duvnos, wherein is the Tree of Immortality, guarded by the Giant Sharvan. Though the monster is virtually immortal, Diarmaid slays him and both he and Gráinne eat the berries of the tree, thereby gaining near-immortality themselves. Diarmaid's death is only brought about by means of enchantment."
