# Albert Pike
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-Pike)
Freemason, officer, and writer. He is very problematic. However, he's included because of his extensive work on the Indo-Iranian branch. Masonry innately focuses more on Abrahamic traditions, but Pike brought Perisan and Vedic thought into the conversation.
