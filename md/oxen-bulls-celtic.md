# Celtic Oxen & Bulls


o "Bulls were venerated for their strength, their virility and roaring ferocity."
o "Oxen were symbolic of…agriculture and wealth."
o "Bull sacrifice was not uncommon: elderly oxen were ritually slaughtered at Gournay, and their bodies subjected to elaborate rites…the Roman writer Pliny refers to a druidical bull-sacrifice."
o "figurines of the sixth century BC have been found at Hallstatt in Austria and Byciskala."
o "Celtic bull-images are often…triple-horned…enhancing the symbolism of the horn (…aggression and fertility) to the sacred power of three. Stone triple-horned bulls were dedicated at the Burgundian shrine of Beire-le-Châtel; and bronze examples occur in Gaul and in Britain. One figurine of the fourth century AD comes from a shrine at Maiden Castle, Dorset, and once was adorned with images of three women on its back. In Irish legend women were sometimes transformed into cranes, and the Maiden Castle figurine calls to mind some curious Continental iconography dating to the first century AD: one carving, from Paris, depicts a bull with three cranes perched on its back and head…Almost identical imagery is present on a stone at Trier. Both stones depict the bull and birds associated with willow trees and a divine wood-cutter…some scholars have advanced theories of seasonal symbolism, related to the Tree of Life, spring and fertility."
o "The [Irish?] tarbhfhess was a divinatory rite involving a bull sacrifice, presided over by druids; the bull's flesh and broth were consumed by a man who then slept and dreamed of the rightful king-elect. The most important Irish bull-myth is the Táin Bó Cuailnge in the Ulster Cycle.
