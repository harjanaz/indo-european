## Abstract
In several Indo-European myths the river/water deities `*deh2nu-s` or `*dhonu-s` are opposed to the gods or heroes related to `*h2ner(t)-` ‘virile strength, man.’ The `*h2ner-` men fight against them and wed their women. The name of the leader of the `*deh2nu-` / `*dhonu-s` is comparable with the West Semitic theonym Baal ‘lord.’ The mythic adversaries of the `*h2ner-s` were probably conflated with a real Semitic tribe. 
Note 1: M.R. Dexter (1990; 1990a: 42-46; EIEC: 486 f.), examining almost all the mythic figures comparable with `*dánu-` / `*dhonu-`, considers them as reflections of an obscure prehistoric tribe, personified as a feminine water deity, who were subdued by the Indo-Europeans. For other aspects of reconstruction, see Petrosyan 1997: 102 ff.; Petrosyan 2002a: 99 ff.)
