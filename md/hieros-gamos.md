# Hieros Gamos
[[d-knight2012]]
- Sky Father & Eath Mother
-  (Grk. Uranus, Hittite Uarsa, Vedic Varsa/Varesta (=Varuna? & Mitra-Varuna?)) impregnates impregnates mother earth (gaia).
-  Odin & Jörð
-  Zeus & Hera (her symbol is a cow, like Audhumla)

- Often the Sky Father and Earth Mother had at least one child who is considered to be a Hero or savior. Thor (though fulfilling the role of the Sky father), Baldr, Mithras, Heracles, Dionysus, and Shakyamuni Buddha are examples of this. The Abrahamic Christ figure is, in all practicality, a copy and paste of this archetype. These divinely born saviors are often associated with solar energy and defined as shining, white, pure, or holy through the divinity of the dawn itself may separately appear as a female for balance.
