# Groves
Sacred space demarcated from the profane world via a symbolic barrier which enclosed the numinous area. A piece of ground designated as holy and thus a focus for communication with the supernatural. Generally Circular, square, or rectangular. Seen as dark, mysterious and secret.

***Goloring Grove in Germany***

- Huge enclosure

- 6th century BC

- At its centre was an enormous wooden post, 40ft high, perhaps symbolic of a sacred tree

***Libeniče Grove***

- Date: 4th century BC

- A great sub-rectangular enclosure

- Shrine: A sunken, unroofed structure was located at one end. Inside were the remains of 2 timbers associated with 2 bronze torcs, perhaps once crude images of deities. It also contained, sacrificial deposits of animals and the body of a women (possibly the priestess). Successive pits had been dug into the floor over a period of 24 years.

[Tacitus: Anglesey Grove]

[Strabo: Drunemeton Grove of the Galatians in Asia Minor]

***Marseille Grove***

- [Lucan, Pharsalia] "The axe men came on an ancient and sacred grove. Its interlacing branches enclosed a cool central space into which the sun never shone, but where an abundance of water spouted from dark springs…the barbaric gods worshipped here had their altars heaped with hideous offerings, and every tree was sprinkled with human blood…Nobody dared enter this grove except the priest; and even he kept out at midday, and between dawn and dusk--for fear that the gods might be abroad at such hours."

- Felled by Caesar's army in the 1st century BC
