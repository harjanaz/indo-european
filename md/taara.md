# Estonian Tunder God Taara
Tooru, Tharapita and Tarapitha

Thunder was worshipped by the peasants in the Middle Ages and there exist data of a Thunder priest even from the 1644. 

Folkloric data also give evidence of the cult of a god in some way related to Scandinavian Tor (taara, tooru, toari, tuuri etc.) The same is also reflected in the holiness of Thursday. Work on Thursday evenings was locally prohibited in Estonian villages even in the early twentieth century.Â
