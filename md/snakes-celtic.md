# Celtic Snakes
§ Underworld, rebirth (skin shedding), associated with Sirona, 
§ Ram-headed snakes found in Romano-Celtic Gaul
			□ Combination of Classical fertility imagery (ram) and regeneration
Feature in Irish myths, but there are no snakes in Ireland, so these myths must be old 


o "[their] earthbound nature…[linked them to] the Underworld"
o "its habit of sloughing its skin has caused it to be perceived as a symbol of rebirth, hence its association with healer-deities such as Sirona."
o "linked with fertility-imagery, perhaps because of their phallic shape, the double penis of the male and the multiple young produced at one birth." 
o "The snake's earthbound nature, its carnivorous feeding-habits and its ability to kill gave it powerful chthonic symbolism. This is displayed most clearly in the iconography of the Jupiter-columns, where the monster of darkness is represented by a Giant with serpents replacing his legs."
o "In Classical religion, serpents were symbols of beneficence and also of death."
o "ram-headed serpents: these occur particularly in Romano-Celtic Gaul. The symbolism is generally interpreted as representative of the combined imagery of fertility (the ram was symbolic of fecundity in the Classical world) and regeneration. These hybrid creatures often accompany beneficent deities of abundance or healing: Cernunnos and the Celtic equivalent of Mercury or Mars in his Gaulish role as guardian against misfortune are examples."
o "Snakes feature in a number of Irish myths. This itself is interesting because, since there are no snakes in Ireland, the implication must be that these snake-myths are of great antiquity. The war-furry, the Morrigán, has a son, Meiche, who is slain by Dian Cécht, the divine physician, because he was three snakes in his heart. There was a prophecy that, if the serpents were allowed to mature, they would destroy all the animals in Ireland. The Ulster champion Conall Cernach has an encounter with a great treasure-guarding snake. The Welsh cleric Giraldus Cambrensis wrote an account of a gold torc guarded by a snake in Pembrokeshire well. The theme of a treasure-guarding serpent is widespread in European legend: it has its equivalent, for instance, in Fafnir of Norse myth."
