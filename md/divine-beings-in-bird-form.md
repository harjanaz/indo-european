gods, valkyries

## Germanic & Celtic Gods, Goddesses, Valkyries
> Such aspects of bird lore are referred to in the Edda poems, and in the ninth century Hrafnsm√°l the stanzas form a dialogue between a raven and a valkyrie. She is said to account herself wise because she understood the language of birds, and is herself described as 'the white-throated one with bright eyes', which suggests that she herself was in bird form. Goddesses, as well as Odin himself, travel in the form of birds, and the same is true of the battle-goddesses of Ireland." ([[h-davidson1988]]p86-87)
