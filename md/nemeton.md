# A Nemeton
Sacred space
From Nemetona, a Gaulish goddess "She of the Sacred Grove"
From nemos "sky"

Groves
	Garrán (non-oak)
	Doire (oak) (prn. doy-ruh) [ex. Derry, Ireland]
	
The saying “Beware of an oak, it draws the stroke; avoid an ash, it courts the flash; creep under the thorn, it can save you from harm.” is a testament to how lightning strikes these trees. Almost as if anointing the trees in doirí(groves) by the gods directly. Lightning in view of our understanding of Samos and Giamos is a form of the Samos current.

nemetons are where the sky is brought down to earth.
