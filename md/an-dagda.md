# An Dagda
§ "the tribal father-god, provider of plenty and regeneration."
§ "His two main attributes were a great club, or which one end killed and the other restored to life, and an enormous, inexhaustible cauldron."
§ "[He is paradoxical] he is portrayed as gross and uncouth, a ridiculous, grotesque figure, who wears an indecently short tunic and eats an outrageous amount, while at the same time he is a powerful father of his tribe. This, though, is all part of his symbolism as god of fertility. Various legends concern his union with different goddesses, including Boann, goddess of the River Boyne. His coupling with the fearsome battle-fury, the Morrigán, ensures security for his people."

Dagda DAGH-duh, the ‘gh’ is a soft G sound made in the back of the throat; anglicized DAHG-duh: His name means ‘The Good God,’ or ‘Best God,’ as in ‘Good at many things.’ Also known as Echu Ollathair   ECH-oo OLL-uh-therr; the ‘ch’ is as in ‘loch’ or ‘Bach,’ not as in ‘choose’ (‘Great Father of Many Horses’) and Ruadh Rofhessa ROO-udh ro-ESS-uh; the ‘dh’ symbolizes the ‘th’ sound in the word ‘other’] ‘Red or Noble one of Great Knowledge’) this powerful and beneficent god has a very wide range of attributes: wisdom, battle, fertility, abundance, music, kingship, the weather, the harvest, and more. He appears in a number of Irish myths which should be read in order to understand his attributes fully. He is the father of Bríg (Brigit) and Oengus Mac Óg (whom he has with Boand, goddess of the River Boyne).
