  The "Woman's Month"
  Just as the master of the house was to rise before the rest of the household and welcome Þorri with a special ceremony, the housewife was to welcome the month of Góa.
  The verbal tradition in Iceland says that farmers held a blót to bid Gói welcome.

  Konudagur (Wife’s Day) – 24 February. Konudagur marks the first day of the month of Góa. On this day husbands are to pamper their wives and shower them with gifts and flowers.
