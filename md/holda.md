# Holda
Germanic
Holda, Holde, Holle, Dame Holda

"Governs the act of spinning, keeps order in the hall, and ride the Wild Hunt with Odin.  " [1]

"She has a great deal of similarity with Frigga, which has made some scholars think the two are one and the same." [1]

"Snow is referred to as Holda shaking out her feather bed.  When plague hit a village, if some died and others lived, then Holda had visited the village with her rake. If, however, everyone died, then it was said that Holda had visited with her broom.  This associates her with the dead...She is known to keep the souls of children and, in the Christian Period, the unbaptized souls of babies as well.  This in turn associates Holda with children and the caring of children's souls after death." [1]
