God sceal on heofenum, dǣda dēmend. (35-36)

God must [be] in the heavens, the Judge of deeds.

Nǣni eft cymeð
hider under hrōfas, þe þæt hēr, for sōð,
mannum secge hwylc      sȳ Meotodes gesceaft,
sigefolca gesetu,     þǣr Hē sylfa wunað. (63-66)

No-one comes back
hither under the roofs, who here, in truth,
might tell men what the Creator's decree is,
[or] the dwelling of the victorious people, where He Himself lives.
