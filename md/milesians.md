# Gaels/Milesians
· "[The] descendants of the Sons of Míl..."
· "They dispossessed the Tuatha Dé, causing them to create a new kingdom beneath the earth."
· "They encountered three...goddesses of the land, Banbha, Fódla and Ériu. Each demanded a promise from the invaders that, if they were successful in establishing themselves in Ireland, they would name the land after her. The seer or fili Amhairghin assured Ériu that Ireland would bear her name and, in return, Ériu prophesized that the land would belong to the Gaels for all time."
"The Christian monks who wrote the Book of Invasions gave this story...a resemblance to the biblical Book of Exodus"
The Milesians...led by the poet Amairgen (Amhairghin) who used his Moses-like prophetic power and wisdom to push aside the defending cloud of mist arranged by Tuatha Dé Danaan on the Feast of Beltene (May Day). The poet in a sense sings the new Ireland of the Celts into existence, containing within himself. like Krsna-Visnu in the Bhagavad Gītā...al the elements of creation..."
[Eventually the Milesians conquered the Tuatha] "The peace settlement left the Celts in control of the world above ground and the Tuatha in control of the land below. The Tuatha were said from then on to live in sidhe, underground mounds, and were themselves referred to ever after as the sidh, the fairies or little people of Irish legends."
