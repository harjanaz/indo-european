"Wyrd, according to Bates (2002, p.76 [The Real Middle Earth]), was the 'inexorable, deeply embedded evolution of the world within which human affairs ebbed and flowed' (p.76), an almost faceless force that seemed to control men's destinies. Tolkien also was attracted by the power and elusiveness of this concept. In his notes entitled the 'Development of wyrd' (Tolkien A28/B, f. 123) he proposed that mortality was the main concern and hidden anxiety of men, and he linked this directly to the concept of wyrd. This was in effect linked to death, 'or the end and destruction of things of worth'. Most importantly wyrd becomes "the appointed hour of death", rarely foreseeable with certainty, even when near at hand'. [The Keys of Middle Earth p.212]
