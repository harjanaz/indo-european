> "...the Vedic gods themselves are also sacrificers. As the á¹šgveda tells us in an enigmatically involuted phrase, 'the gods sacrificed sacrifice by sacrifice; these were the first oridinances.' This celebrated line refers to the primordial immolation of the cosmic man, who is at the same time identified with the instituition of sacrifice. Here sacrifice has no connection with any gift. Instead, it is the primordial act of cosmogonic violence. [...] the 'charter' of sacrifice as an instituition." [[j-heesertman1993]]
