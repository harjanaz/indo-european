## Notes

- **§1**  **IE & Saami connections**  Celtic *Sidhe* = *sieidi* (a cultic place like a river or stone) p15. Norse *vanir* = *vanhem* (parents) p24. Norse *thor* = *tiermes* (thundergod) p25. Baltic *auskeli* (morning star) = *aske* (moon) p28.  Baltic *menno* (moon god) = *mano* (moon) p29.  Baltic *alkas/elkas* (sacred forests, lakes) = *akka* (mothers, spirits) p29. 

- **§2**  "Fal = the 'stone penis' on the 'Hill of Tara'" p17  He's refering to *Lia Fáil* [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lia-F%C3%A1il)

- **§3**  The PIEs developed out of and broke from a proto-culture (which was preserved by others like the Yukaghirs) around 5000BPE. This new culture self consciously saw itself as seperating from and overcoming the old culture. This new religion emphasized national gods and heros (who were often in conflict with the old divinites of the proto-culture as well as with natural forces). This valuation of the hero was racial, but nevertheless these were the same peoples just a new religious culture. p23-4 the Yukaghir (and saami) part is eh, but the idea is cool
