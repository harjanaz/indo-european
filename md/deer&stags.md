# Deer & Stags
[[m-fomin2018]]

o "their speed, their virility and their spreading antlers…evoked their image as lords of the forest. The Iron Age rock-art of Camonica Valley in north Italy features sacred stags which are often depicted as the focus of hunting-ritual. The imagery on a seventh-century-BC model bronze cult-wagon at Strettweg in Austria is of a divine stag-hunt presided over by a goddess. In later Celtic iconography the deer is the companion not only of hunter-gods but also of the god Cernunnos, who was himself antlered…In the Fionn Cycle, Fin himself is closely associated with deer-imagery: his wife, Sava, is a metamorphized doe and the name of their son, Oisin, means 'Little Deer'. Finn is one of the hunters enticed to the Otherworld by means of enchanted stags."
