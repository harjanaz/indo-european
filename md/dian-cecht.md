§ "god of...healing, [he] derived his power from a combination of magic and herblore; he was at the same time a doctor and a smith."
§ "[He] had the power to heal by magic: he restored dead members of the Tuatha Dé Danann by chanting incantations over a well in which the slain warriors were immersed."


Dian Cecht [DEE-uhn Cecht; the ‘ch’ is as in ‘loch or ‘Bach,’ not as in ‘choose’]. His name could be translated as ‘Swift One of Power or Cutting,’ and he is a Physician God. He helps heal wounded warriors of the Tuatha De Danann in Cath Maige Tuired. He makes a silver hand for the wounded Tuatha De Danann king Nuadu, but his son Miach [MEE-uch, ‘ch’ as in ‘loch’ or ‘Bach, not as in ‘choose’] creates a flesh-and-blood arm for him; out of jealousy, Dian Cecht kills Miach. The spell Miach uses to heal Nuadu comes from an old Indo-European magical formula. After his death, his sister Airmid gathered up the 365 herbs and spread them out on her cloak according to her healing properties. The angry Dian Cecht mixed them up so their properties were not known. (Naughty Dian Cecht. Luckily, we have unscrambled many of the herbs!) : [https://discoverdruidry.wordpress.com/2018/05/28/calling-to-the-hollow-hills-irish-gods-names-and-attributes/]
