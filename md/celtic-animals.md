# Celtic Animals
	· Were revered
	
	· Vague boundaries between animals and humans
		○ Deities semi-zoomorphic and metamorphic

	· "absence of rigid boundaries between animal and human form…deities could be envisaged as semi-zoomorphic. The myths…abound in enchanted animals which had once bene human, and divinities in human form who could shape-change to the form of an animal at will."
"complexity and diversity of animal sacrifice"


	· Hunting:
		○ "there existed a special and complicated relationship...reverence and an acknowledgment of theft from the natural world, which required appropriate propitiatory ritual. The gods of the hunt protected the denizens of the wild as well as promoting the hut itself. Sometimes this ambivalence is displayed in Celtic imagery, where the god shows tenderness toward his prey."
"may be the means by which contact is made between earthly life and the Otherworld."

	


· Zoomorphism
	· [Carving, 1st Century AD, Paris, part of the same monument as the Tarvostrigaranus stone]: "depicts the bust of an elderly man with antlers, a torc hanging from each, and the ears of a stag. The inscription…identifies him as 'Cernunnos' ('Horned One'). Similar images occur in both pre-Roman and Romano-Celtic contexts. The earliest representation is on a fourth-century-BC rock carving at Camonica Valley in north Italy. The antlered god appears on the Gundestrup Cauldron, seated cross legged, again with two torcs, and with his stag beside him. Beneath the god is a ram-horned serpent. Most images of Cernunnos occur in north-east Gaul and date to the Roman period. He is often depicted as he is at Gundestrup, cross legged, with torcs and a horned snake. At such sites as Sommerécourt and Étang-sur-Arroux in Gaul the snakes eat from bowls of mash on the god’s lap. A rare British example, at Cirencester, portrays Cernunnos with two snakes which form his legs and rear up to eat corn or fruit by his head. Some Gaulish images have holes in the top of the head for detachable antlers, possibly evoking seasonal ritual. The general symbolism of Cernunnos is that of a wild god of nature, fertility and plenty. He is so close to the animal world that he actually takes on some characteristics of a beast, thus enhancing his potency as lord of Nature.
	· Essentially similar to Cernunnos are the horned gods, who adopt the features of bulls, rams or goats. These are especially popular among the Brigantes of north Britain, where they frequently appear as ithyphallic warrior-gods, thus linking sexual vigor with military aggression.
· Metamorphosis
	· “the concept of enchanted, magical animals which may be of supernatural origin, perhaps metamorphized gods or humans who have been changed into animals in revenge or as a punishment.”
	· “transmogrified beings…Twrch Trwyth…the Irish raven-goddesses. In the Mabinogi, Gwydion and Gilfaethwy are transformed into a succession of animals by Math, lord of Gwynedd. Irish mythology is full of enchanted bulls, boars, stags and birds. A constant characteristic of all transmogrified creatures is that only their physical form is altered; they retain the ability to think as humans and they can often still speak. They are skin-changers, very similar to those of Norse myth.
	· The western Celtic myths contain allusions to special animals with supernatural powers. Thus the Welsh Culhwch encounters magical creatures who help him in his quest. One of these is the Salmon of Llyn Llaw, a creature which bears a close resemblance to the Irish Salmon of Knowledge, chronicled in the Fionn Cycle, whose flesh imparts wisdom to the young Finn.  This salmon gained its knowledge by eating the nuts of the nine hazel trees which grew beside a well at the bottom of the sea, in other words from the Otherworld.

o "reverence and an acknowledgement of theft from the natural world, which required appropriate propitiatory ritual.

o "Many divine hunters are accompanied by dogs"
o "The concept of the divine hunt possess…regenerative symbolism. The spilling of the blood of the hunted means food and life for the hunters. In the Welsh and Irish mythological tradition the hunt may be the means by which contact is made between earthly life and the Otherworld. In Irish myth beings from the supernatural world lured human hunters, such as Finn, to their realm by means of enchanted animals. In the Mabinogi, it is a stag-hunt which brings together Pwyll and the Otherworld king, Arawn.
