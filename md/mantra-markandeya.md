				It is all in this moment
				It is all it is all in this moment
				Lost in the Deep Blue 
				Lost in the Deep Blue 

				Let thunder roar 
				Lightning flash a thousand times 
				Across the sky 

				The gods of war 
				Let them strike a thousand times
				Love never dies

				Let the sunshine evaporate (all the negative forces)
				Into electric air 
				Love remains 
				Unchanged

				It is all it is all in this moment 
				Lost in the deep blue
				Lost in the deep blue 
				In the deep blue 
				In the deep blue
