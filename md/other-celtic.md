"Stone statuette of a god wearing a torc, for Euffigneix, France. He has an eye-symbol on his side, perhaps to indicate the all-seeing power of the god…"
"Stone relief showing a genius cucullatus with an egg and a mother-goddess with fruit or bread, from Cirencester, Gloucestershire. The two deities are often associated in the Cotswold region. The egg is a powerful symbol of new life."


"The invading Celts displaced but were certainly influenced by the religious and mythological traditions of earlier peoples, the builders of stone circles such as Stonehenge."

• from mabinog, or young apprentice bard and 
• associated with the Irish Mac ind oc, a name sometimes given to the god Dagda's son Aonghus (the son of eternal youth). As the four Branches are concerned with the children of Don, who resemble the Irish Tuatha de Danann....[and] the only character to figure in all four tales is Pryderi, who in Wales was always the Mac ind Og. 
• associated with Maponos, the divine youth god popular in northern Britain and the continent, who is the Arthurian warrior and hunter Mabon in Wales. Thus, the theory goes, mabinogi is derived from Mabonalia. The mother of Maponos was the mother goddess Matrona; in Wales she became Madron. In some stories we learn that Mabon was stolen from his mother soon after his birth. 


"Arrival of Noah's granddaughter Cesair (or of Banbha, one of the eponymous queens or symbols of Irish sovereignty) before the Flood....which destroyed all of these first invaders except for Cesair's husband Fintan (the Ancient White One) who, according to some, saved himself by changing into a salmon. The myth claims Fintan survived into the Christian period as a source of knowledge about the past."

"...the Táin and the...Fenian Cycle, the Irish equivalents of the Indian Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana..."
