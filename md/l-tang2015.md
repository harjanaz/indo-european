## Abstract
It is generally agreed that some numbers such as three and nine which appear frequently in the two Eddas hold special significances in Norse mythology. Furthermore, numbers appearing in sagas not only denote factual quantity, but also stand for specific symbolic meanings. This tradition of number symbolism could be traced to Pythagorean thought and to St. Augustine‟s writings. But the result in Old Norse literature is its own system influenced both by Nordic beliefs and Christianity. This double influence complicates the intertextuality in the light of which the symbolic meanings of numbers should be interpreted. At the same time, the influence is better examined because of the cultural collision reflected in number symbolism.
This thesis focuses on eight special numbers (three, seven, eight, nine, ten, twelve, thirteen and eighteen) giving special attention to their symbolism. It then turns to explain how the symbolism of these numbers functions in certain sagas or some specific episodes to suit their author‟s needs. Saga writing is a process combining historical accounts and imaginary additions. Just like the four methods of allegorical interpretation to explain the Bible, saga reading can thus also be made at different levels.
