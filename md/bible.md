Chapter 10 of Genesis, the Table of Nations, describes how the entire Earth was populated by the sons of Noah following the Flood, beginning with the descendants of Japheth. These were the Indo-Europeans who began history.

> "May God make room for Japheth, that he may live in Shem's tents and Canaan may be his slave." (Genesis 9:27)

Josephus says that:
> Japhet, the son of Noah, had seven sons: they inhabited so, that, beginning at the mountains Taurus and Amanus, they proceeded along Asia, as far as the river Tanais (Don), and along Europe to Cadiz; and settling themselves on the lands which they light upon, which none had inhabited before, they called the nations by their own names. (Antiquities of the Jews I.6)
