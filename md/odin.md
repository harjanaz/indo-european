## "Spellcaster"
   He is called "Spellcaster" (ON *Fjolnir*) in ch 17 of the saga of the Volsungs and (quoted from) in *Reginsmál* "[It] is of uncertain exact meaning but apparently formed from a root word that has associations with magical wisdom. (Crawford, 2017: 146.)
## Runes
   "Brynhild attributes magical properties to them in chapter 20 of the Saga of the Volsungs, in lines borrowed from the poem *Sigdrífumál (Sigrdrigumal)* in the Poetic Edda. (Crawford, 2017: 144.)
  
   "There were all sorts
   of runes in that horn,
   carved there and bloodied..." (Crawford, 2017: 66.)
### Brynhild's advise to Sigurđ:
   There are different types of runes
  
   victory-runes
   wave-runes (for ships)
   speech-runes
   beer-runes
   life-saving runes
   limb-runes
   (all *The Saga of the Volsungs* Crawford, 2017: 36-39.)
  
   But Odin is mostly associated with: 
   "You should learn mind-runes
   if you want to be wiser
   than any other man.
   Óđin read them,
   Óđin carved them,
   Óđin thought them up." (*The Saga of the Volsungs* Crawford, 2017: 38.)

   "[Runes] were carved on...Óđin's spearpoint" (*The Saga of the Volsungs* Crawford, 2017: 38.)

   "All of them that were carved
   were then shaved off
   and they were stirred into the holy mead
   and sent far away.
   Some are with the Æsir,
   some are with the elves,
   some are with the Vanir,
   and mortal men have some." (*The Saga of the Volsungs* Crawford, 2017: 39.)
