[[narratives]]

According to [[witzel]] there are two kinds of dragon (i.e. giant reptile) slaying narratives: 
- [[narrative-hero-slays-giant-reptile]]
	- [[narrative-hero-slays-giant-serpent]]
	- [[narrative-hero-slays-giant-lizard]]


Hero slays dragon, slays worm, slays demon, etc. Combat myth.

[Wikipedia: PIE Serpent Slaying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European-mythology#Serpent-slaying-myth)

Sometimes this narrative became a [[creation-cosmogony]] by becoming fused with the [[chaoskampf]] narrative.

Often this hero slays serpents (or dragons). Other times demons.
