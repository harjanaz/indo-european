## Abstract
This note is dedicated to the study of the motif of raven as a scavenging post-Flood scout and its "White Raven" version. In her monograph The Raven and the Carcass, Anna Birgitta Rooth proposed that this motif was brought to all parts of the New World from Western Europe by Catholic missionaries. The article suggests that both "The Raven and the Carcass" motif and its "White Raven" version existed in the New World prior to the European colonization of Americas.
