# PIE Goddess, Daughter of the Sun

- PIE Sawélyosyo Dhugәtḗr "Daughter of the Sun"
- She overlaps with the [Dawn Goddess](dawn-sunrise) who is called the "Daughter of Heaven". In the RV, Uṣas sometimes appears as the daughter of the sun god Sūrya [[(s-jamison1991)]]294, and is given the title ***sū́ ryasya duhitár***. Given the close connection between the sun and the sky god (Dyḗus Ptḗr), with the sun being the eye of Dyḗus Ptḗr, this is no surprise.
