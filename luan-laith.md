# OIr. *Lúan Laith*

"Warrior's Light/Moon"

A ray, or halo, of light sprining from, or lying above, the heads of Irish heroes & princes. A prodigious superhuman sign.

It has other names too as well see:

- ***lúan laeich*** or ***lónn láoich***  *soldier's light/moon*

- (***én gaile***  *bird of war-fury*, *battle-rage bird*). It corresponds to the Iranian ***[xᵛarənah](khvarenah.md)*** as represented in the Yima story of Yt.19.

Sometimes it comes from the skull, the forehead, the whole head, the inside, the outside...the only constant characteristic is that it is correlated to a hero either in the dramatic moment of fight, or for the purpose of underlining that he is destined for great acheivments.

  

#### Etymology

(r-thurneysen 1921p130) interpreted  ***lúan***  as  *moon*,  thus  ***lúan laith***  would have meant  *warrior's moon*

Later, (e-campanile 1988) denied a direct connection with '*moon*'.  Instead he connected ***lúan***  to ****louksno-***  *luminous* and hence it would have meant *luminosity, light, radiance*. In the texts, sometimes ***lúan*** did mean *moon* but only in a few cases and in an indirect way.  Although, the OIr. name for Monday was ***día lúain***, translated via Interpreto Romana as Lat. ***lunae dies***.

  

#### Heroes who have it

- *Cúchulainn* "on his brow; sprang up from his forehead as long and thick as a soldier's whetstone"

- *Loegaire* & *Conall Cernach* "each sprang into his luan laith"

- *Find mac Cumaill* "luan laith came upon him"
