## Dawn = East
- The word for ‘dawn’ *h2 eu̯ s-os- [330], also deified in PIE culture, was derived from *h2 u̯ es- ‘shine’ [246], as are words for ‘east’ in some IE languages (e.g., Germ. *austa-, OE ēast, OHG ōstan, Av. ušastara-, Latv. austrumi), while ‘evening’ and ‘west’ [368] derive from *u̯ esp- ‘enshroud, clothe’ [369] (cf.

Asha *Indo-Iranian
Vohu Manah "Good Mind" *Zoroastrian invention

Asha-vans "followers of Asha" Truth and Righteousness, the Natural Order
Dreg-vans "followers of Druj" Lie, wickedness, disorder; Violates the Natural Order


Gathas: Ox seeks a husbandman and protector; 

Christianity: Sheep seeks a shepherd

Zoroaster against the:
	Daēvas
	Kavi (Kings)
	Karapans ("mummbler" priest who recited the words of traditional liturgy)
	First Man Yima who gave to "our men portions of the flesh of the ox to eat" slaughtered an ox in a sunless place/at night (in honor of the Daēvas) just like the later Mithraic rituals. [In Indian, Yama, becomes the lord of the dead]
	Haoma (fermented plant juice, used by the traditional Karapans/priests)
	
Zoroaster for:
	Ahuras (but never refers to them by their individual names)
	
Like Islam:
One has a moral duty to uphold Asha, and treat Asha-vans with Good and Dreg-vans with Evil. One "should be evil to the followers of the Lie. The man "who is most good to the follower of the Lie is himself a follower of the Lie."
One can convert via free will but it is always secondary.

Zoroaster as judge like christ
