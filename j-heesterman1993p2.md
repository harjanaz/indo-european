> "Rather than a priest, sacririce calls forth the warrior who finds his privileged arena on the place of sarifice. Originally the two figures, priest and warrior, were not mutually exclusive. They seem, on the contrary, to be intimately related. Thus, the Celtic druid 'is not only priest but also a warrior.' Conversely, the *fianna*, the warrior bands, did not admit an aspirant 'unless he was a poet and had studied the twelve books of poetry.' As often is the case, there is a striking suggestive resemblance with the archaic conditions that have left copious traces in the Vedic texts." [[j-heesertman1993]]
