Ériu, Banba and Fotla [AYR-ee-yoo, BAHN-vuh, FODE-luh]. These are the three eponymous goddesses of the land of Ireland, whom the Gaels encounter when they first land on the island. Each wishes to have her name be upon the land, but only Eriu welcomes the Sons of Mil, saying that their arrival had long been prophesied. Indeed, it is her name that is found in the Old Irish name of Ireland (Ériu), which comes from an Indo-European root word *Iweriju, meaning ‘Fat / Fertile land.’ She displays attributes of a land or sovereignty goddess, and is the mother of Bres (whom she has with one of the kings of the Fomorians). All three names were used to denote Ireland by Irish poets throughout the Medieval Period. The consorts of these three goddesses were three kings of the Tuatha De Danann: Mac Cuill (‘Son of Hazel’), Mac Gréine (‘Son of Sun’) and Mac Cecht (‘Son of Plough’).[https://discoverdruidry.wordpress.com/2018/05/28/calling-to-the-hollow-hills-irish-gods-names-and-attributes/]
