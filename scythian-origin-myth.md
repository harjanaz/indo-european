# The Scythian Origin Myth

- Recorded in Herodotus (4.5-6) 

- Three implments/objects of burning gold--a **[cup](cups-grail.md)**, an **ax**, and a **plow with yoke**--fall from the sky and are recovered by the youngest son of Targitaos, the primeval being. The objects symbolize the functions. From their recoverer, Kolaxa√Øs, springs the dominant Scythian class or tribe.  He is the youngest brother and represents the [1st](first-function-sovereignty.md) function. From his two elder brothers, who failed in their attempts to recover the objects, issue the [2nd](functions-second.md) (warrior) and [3rd](third-function.md) (food-producing) classes. The notion of Dual-Sovereignty is absent.
