# PG Wōðanaz
Wōð-a-na-z (NOT Wōð-an-az)

Wōð- = "madness, ecstasy, fury, insanity" 
-a- = compound filler
-na- = "leader of"
-z = nominative ending


Since comound forms of words can be either singular or plural, th name could mean either "Leader of the Wōð" or "Leader of the Wōðy-ones". The later is probably the case since there are similar leadership terms: 
```
PGR harjanaz  = harj-a-na-z "Leader of the Army"
PGR þeuðanaz  = þeuð-a-na-z "Leader of the Tribe"
PGR druhtinaz = druhti-na-z "Leader of the Warband"
PIE                   -no-
LAT Neptunus  = neptu-nu-s  "Ruler of the Ocean/Seas"
LAT Silvānus  = silvā-nu-s  "Ruler of the forest"
```
