# Cú Chulainn
§ Etymology: The "Hound of Culann"
§ "[He is] the archetypal superhuman champion of epic tradition....destined to have a short but glorious life. He is a brave, beautiful, strong, and invincible warrior." 
§ "His father may have been the god Lugh or Conchobar, and there is incest (a mark of divinity) in his immediate ancestry."
§ "As occurs with the Welsh Pryderi, [his] birth is interlocked with that of horses: two foals are born at exactly the same moment as the hero, and they become his chariot-horses, the Grey of Macha and the Black of Saingliu."
§ "When very young, he kills the hound of Culann the Smith, and pledges himself to guard the smithy in the dog's place...he has a geis or bond...not to partake of dog-flesh; he breaks the bond and thus sets the scene for his own destruction." 
§ '[He] is trained by Scáthach, a female teacher of warcraft and prophetess, who foretells [his] future though divination."
§ "[He has] magical weapons and armor, including the Gae Bulga, a barbed spear which inflicts only fatal mounds, and a visor, gift of Manannán the sea-god. [His] charioteer has the power to cast a spell of invisibility over his chariot."
§ "...of all the Ulstermen only he is exempt from Macha's curse, a weakness inflicted upon them in time of crisis."
§ "When the battle-rage is on him, he goes into "warp-spasm", a berserk fit when he can no longer distinguish friend from foe...he becomes a monster: his body spins within its skin; his hair stands on end, surrounded by a halo of light; his muscles swell; one eye bulges, the other sinks into his head; his howl causes all the local spirits to howl with him, driving the enemy mad with terror."
§ "He uses magic to halt the advances of the Connacht-men; he has magical power over animals; he is linked with sacred numbers, having triple-colored hair, seven pupils in each eye and seven digits on each hand and foot....he visits the Otherworld while still alive. 
§ "[His] death at Magh Muirtheimne is surrounded with portents: when harnessed for the final battle, the Grey of Macha weeps tears of blood, and when [he]  mounts his chariot, all his weapons fall at his feet.  Lastly he encounters the "Washer at the Ford" washing his armor, a sure sign of doom in Insular myth. The hero-light around his head dims and his death is signaled by the Babh or the Morrigán..."
