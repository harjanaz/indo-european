# Lugh
[[merceron2018]]

§ Etymology: "Shining One"
§ "The Gaulish word lugos can mean 'raven', and there is a tenuous link between Lugh and these birds."
§ "...related by blood both to the Tuatha Dé Danann and the Fomorians."
§ "skilled in...arts and crafts"
§ "...god of light..."
§ "[His] summer festival was Lughnasad."
§ "...a warrior-hero, a sorcerer and master of crafts....some scholars...identify him with the Gaulish Mercury, whom Caesar describes as 'inventor of all the arts'."
§ "He himself slew the formidable Balor, leader of the Fomorians (and Lugh's own grandfather)."
§ "In battle [he] used both his own magic and the enchanted sword and boat of Manannán."
§ "[His] 'surname' was Lámfhada ('of the Long Arm'), a possible reflection of his skill with the throwing-spear or sling (with which weapon he killed Balor).
§ "The myths of Lugh are not confined to the Book of Invasions. In the Ulster Cycle the god appears as the Otherworld father of Cú Chulainn, who soothes and heals the young hero after his confrontations with the forces of Connacht.

Holiday: Lughnasad

Lug [LOOGH, the ‘gh’ is a soft ‘g’ sound in the back of the throat; anglicized as Loog or Loo]. The meaning of his name is not known (no matter what people tell you), although it may derive from an Indo-European word meaning ‘light’. This does not mean he is a ‘sun god,’ which is an outdated Victorian way of looking at deities. It has tenuous possible linguistic link with Gaulish words denoting ‘raven’ or ‘lynx,’ but these are problematic and best avoided. Lug is sometimes referred to as Lug Mac Eithlenn [MAHK ETH-lenn] (‘Son of the divine figure Ethliu) and also by the epithet Samildánach [SAH-vill-DAH-nach; the ‘ch’ is as in ‘loch’ or ‘Bach,’ not as in ‘choose’] which means ‘Many Skilled.’ Lug appears to be the Irish reflex of a pan-European Celtic deity elsewhere known as Lugos / Lugus (on the mainland) and later in the medieval Welsh figure of Lleu Llaw Gyffes. His many skills are enumerated in Cath Maige Tuired, when he approaches Tara and declares himself to be a warrior, poet, harper, craftsman, cupbearer, physician, and so forth.
