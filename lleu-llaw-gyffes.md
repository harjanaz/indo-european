# Lleu Llaw Gyffes
· "the Bright One of the Skillful Hand"
· "his birth to a mother who is apparently a virgin"
· "His destiny imposed upon him by his hostile mother is interesting: she denies him name, weapons and a wife, the three rites of passage which are necessary for the attainment of manhood. It is only by Gwydion's--the magician-- magic that Lleu can reach maturity."
· "[His] death is equally contradictory: he cannot be killed inside or out-of-doors, neither on land nor water, neither naked nor clothed, and only by a spear made at a time when work is forbidden."
· "Lleu is probably an ancient British god, perhaps cognate with the Irish Lugh with whom he shares a name associated with light. His birth, destiny and immortality imply his divine status, as does the care taken to protect him by the magician Gwydion. The deception, riddle and contradiction which underpin "Math" are all devices common to myth and may be found equally in the Irish tradition and in stories of the Graeco-Roman pantheon."
