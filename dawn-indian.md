[PIE Dawn ](dawn-sunrise)
# Indian Dawn Goddess (Uṣas)

### Family
- Uṣas (and only Uṣas) is called *duhitā divas* “daughter of Dyaus” (RV 1.92.7)[[(r-matasovič1996)]]32, [[?-nagy1973]]165. She was called the "Daughter of Heaven" (PIE *dhugH2tḗr diwós*) [[(m-dexter1997a)]]149.
- Because she is the daughter of Sky Father, she overlaps with the [Sun Goddess](sun-goddess.md) who is called "Daughter of the Sun". 
- Sister of [Aśvins](sky-sons-indian) [[(d-ward1968)]]11. As such, because they are connected with horses, she is desribed as the color Skt. *bradhná*- "the pale red-yellow or horse coats".

### Her Importance
She is the most-invoked goddess in the Rig Veda. (m-dexter1997)148.

### Plural word form and the Dawn Maidens
Often she is invoked in the plural [[(j-puhvel1987)]]60. This could simply be a poetic way of indicating the dawns of everyday, or maybe it refers to Dawn and her Maidens [[(p-friedrich1979)]]296. This especially clear in the Rig Veda, as in 1.92.1, “the Dawns have made their bright appearance” [[(r-panikkar1977)]].
