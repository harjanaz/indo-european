Welcome to *The Indo-European Bibliography*,  a site which aims to gather all information on the Indo-Europeans in one place. You'll find pages on everything from [poetics](ie-poetics.md), to prehistoric [deities](pie-deities.md), [conversion](syncretism-conversion-isation.md), and even some other proto-peoples like the [proto-austronesians](baldick2013.md). It contains over 5000 pages as of Sep 5th 2021. 

Learn more [[about]] the project, go to the [[home]] page, or meet the curator [Erick Dodge](dodge.md).
