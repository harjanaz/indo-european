# Nuadu

[[d-gricourt-d-hollard2018]]


§ "[His] name...may be...linked with Nodens, whose large sanctuary on the River Severn was erected in the third century AD..."
§ "[The] king of the Tuatha De, but he had to relinquish his power after he lost his arm in battle [at Magh Tuiredh]: Insular rulers had to be physically perfect. During the interregnum...a surrogate king was appointed...Bres ("the Beautiful")"
§ "Nuadu was restored to the kingship after Dian Cécht made him a new arm, and he was thereafter known as Nuadu Argatlámh ("Nuadu of the Silver Arm"). But Nuadu was demoralized over the constant conflict with the Fomorians, and the young Lugh took over as leader."
§ "Nuadu may be identified with Nodens, the healer-god of Lydney in Gloucestershire: both names may mean "Cloud-Maker", as if perhaps they were weather-gods."

Nuadu [NOO-uh-dhoo; the ‘dh’ represents the ‘th’ sound in ‘other’]. The name of this deity is cognate with that of a British deity named Nodons / Nodens, who is known to have been venerated at a Romano-Celtic healing sanctuary. Nuadu Airgetlam [AHR-get-lahv, which means ‘Silver Hand / Arm’] was an early king of the Tuatha De Danann. Rather than a god who provides healing, he seems to have received healing at the hands of Dian Cecht and then Miach. He gives up his throne to Lug after he arrived at Tara.
