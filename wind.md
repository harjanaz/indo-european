- PIE *h₂weh₁-* "to blow"
- PIE *Xuḗtōs* "winds"
- Skt. vā

- “Winds.” Seen as plural. There are cults of the winds in many Indo-European cultures, including India, Anatolia, and Rome, as well as among the Balts (Vejōspatis; Polomé, 1985, 31; West, 2007, 263-5) and Slavs (Větrъ; Dvornik, 1956, 50; Jakobson, 1972, 8). 341-2). 

### Greece
- They were worshiped in Greece as early as the Linear B tablets (Parker, 2011, 77, n. 35), where there was a priestess of them (Burkert, 1985, 43). In Pindar, Pythian 4:194-5, the Argonauts offer to the winds, along with other deities, including Zeus, and at Corneia (Pausanias 9.34.3) and Titane (Pausanias 2.12.1) there were altars to them; in Attica there was a shrine to the North Wind in gratitude for wrecking the Persian fleet (Parker, 2011, 74). It is no surprise that their cult is particularly popular among sailors. Horace, Epodes 10, hoping for someone to be shipwrecked and drowned, promises a goat and a lamb to the Tempestati, “the Storms,” by which he may have meant the winds. 
### Slavs
- Connected to warfare [[(r-zaroff1999)]]63
### Iranian
- Vayu averted danger, particularly that which came from demons. 
- Vayu was sacrificed to by unmarried women who wish to obtain husbands 
- [[(j-duchesne1969)]]
### Indian
- In RV 10.90.13, when the cosmos is made from the sacrificed Puruṣa, Vāyu is created from his breath. 
- The Vedic word for “soul,” atman, is cognate with German atmen, “to breathe.” Is there a connection between the Winds (PIE Xuḗtōs),  human breath, and the human soul.
