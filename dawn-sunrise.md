### Characteristics

- She was a beautiful maiden.
- Xáusōs is the most confidently reconstructed of the Proto-Indo-European goddesses, both by name and by function. This is no surprise; dawn, after all, travels with the tribe. Her importance is reflected in Uṣas being the most-invoked goddess in the Rig Veda. [[(m-dexter1997a)]]148
- "Keeper of the gates of dawn"?

---

### Family
- She was the daughter of [Sky Father](pie-sky-father.md) and  called the "Daughter of Heaven" (PIE *dhugH2tḗr diwós*) [[(m-dexter1997a)]]149.
- She overlaps with the "Daughter of the Sun" Goddess. In the RV, Uṣas sometimes appears as the daughter of the sun god Sūrya [[(s-jamison1991)]]294, and is given the title ***sū́ ryasya duhitár***. Given the close connection between the sun and the sky god (Dyḗus Ptḗr), with the sun being the eye of Dyḗus Ptḗr, this is no surprise.
- There may have been another goddess, that of [Dusk](dusk.md), perhaps Dawn's sister.

### Her Moral Ambiguity

> Although a beautiful maiden, Xáusōs is not all sweetness and light. Dawn is ambivalent. It is neither night nor day. The dark has been safely navigated, but the light is not yet here. And it might not come. Xáusōs is the keeper of the gates of dawn. Will she open them? There is always the chance that she might not. And even when she does come, her gift is ambivalent. Each day brings us closer to death. Xáusōs is  a goddess to be welcomed, but with care. See:
> - [[The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite 218-38]]
> - [[RV 1.092.10]] from [[(w-oflaherty1980)]]136
> - [[TS 4.3.11.5]] from [[m-west2007]]225.
> 
> The ambiguity has another source. Since dawn is neither night nor day, it's between one thing and another. It doesn't really belong; despite taking part in the Xártus, and even being an important part of its operation, it doesn't really belong to the Xártus, because it doesn't have a definite identity. It thus shares in both the promise and danger of Chaos. As a result, dawn rituals express some hopeful thinking and try to work a little magic. Through them it will be the promise we get, not the danger.
> Even with the ambiguity, Xáusōs is an upholder of order, of the Xártus. Uṣas (together with her sister, Night) is a "shining mother of order" (RV. 1.142.7; in Macdonell, 1897, 129). The sun does rise, and as long as we continue our own proper behavior it will continue to do so.

### Connection to Birch Trees
- Xausós is connected with birch trees. The birch is one of the first trees to reawaken in the spring, and thus an apt symbol for a dawn and spring goddess. Its white bark connects it with purity (Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, 1995, 522-3). According to Paul Friedrich (in Mallory and Adams, 1997, 65), "The birch was a symbol for the feminine and specifically for young, virginal femininity in PIE times." He also suggests that PIE *bherHxgyos "birch" might have been formed from a root meaning "bright," or that the two might have become connected via folk etymology (Friedrich, 1970, p. 27). The Hittite parku "ritually pure; innocent" comes from the Proto-Indo-European word for birch, and in the Baltic languages "birch" has connections with purity and innocence (Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, 1995, 532-3).

### Plurality and Dawn Maidens & Cows
- In a number of stories, the Dawn is plural. This especially clear in the Rig Veda, as in 1.92.1, "the Dawns have made their bright appearance" (Panikkar, 1997). The idea might be that all of the dawns of the year (or from that point on) are referred to; Friedrich (1979, 296) suggests that this might refer to Dawn and her maidens. West (2007, 224) suggests that the 350 cows and 350 sheep of the god Helios in the Odyssey were the days and nights of the year. This comparison of dawn with cows is widespread. For instance, “[Uṣas] uncovers her breast as a cow her udder” (RV 1.92.4) (West, 2007, 224). In the myths surrounding the demonic Paṇis and Vala, both dawn and cows are among the treasures rescued by the gods (Srinivasan, 1973). In that myth, “cow” might refer to Uṣas’ rays (Srinivasan, 1973, 53). Horses are also rescued, and we have seen from earlier that cows and horse are complementary opposites in Indo- European thought. Again we see the ambiguity of Dawn. Of the two, however, in this case it is the cow that Uṣas is identified with; Dawn is described as coming as a cow, not a mare.

### Connection to Birth
- As the bringer of light, it is possible to see Xausós as a birth goddess, as was Lucina, the Italic “goddess of light” (Salmon, 1967, 153) Uṣas was transfunctional; she was "endowed with knowledge," "strong with strength," and "bestowing all treasures" (Robbins, in Mallory and Adams, 1997, 149).

### Little Red Riding Hood
- Little Red Riding Hood is the Dawn goddess. The Big Bad Wolf is the night, from which the dawn has to escape.

### Connection to Dancing
- Hillebrandt (1980,I: 24) points out that RV 10.29.2 refers to the dance of Uṣas, and West (2007, 221) relates that Uṣas was described as "like a dancer" (RV 1.92.4), Eos has dancing places (Odyssey 12.4), and the Baltic Saule is described as a dancer. This may be connected with descriptions of the sun dancing on the horizon. Dances might therefore be something good to include in rituals in her honor.

## Chinese Connection
- Several Chinese goddesses are similar to the PIE sun goddes and the dawn goddes, implying influence from them through trade routes in Tocharian territories and therefore their worship there. (j-snow2002)
