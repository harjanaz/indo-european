# Hospitality

[[s-jamison1996]]
- PIE The stranger, *ghosti- [301], could be viewed both as one who had the right of hospi- tality, hence ‘guest’ in Germanic (: Goth. gasts) and Slavonic (: OCS gostь, most proba- bly borrowed from Germanic), and as one who presents a danger to society, hence Latin hostis ‘enemy’, but also hospes ‘host’ from *ghosti-poti- ‘master of the guest’, cf. Benveniste (1969.1: 87−101). [[j-klein-et2017-20]]

- It should be seen as a micro-ethical thing, and not a macro or political virtue. The Anglo Saxons would NOT have been abliged to provide "hospitality" to the viking raiders. It was limited to the home, not the nation. "Accomidate a needy stranger in your home for the night".
- The Guest is also bound to certain obligations, which if neglated, would releave the host of his duty of hospitality. "Don't out stay your welcome".
