## Abstract
This chapter explores one type of religious practice well attested in both Anatolian and Aegean sources, which can be argued to have a special connection with the Luwian sphere. The religious practice in question is augury or ornithomancy, the practice of divination through observing the movement of birds. Evidence for bird oracles in the Hittite archives has been studied extensively in recent years, and neither the hypothesis that 'Hittite' augury was Luwian, nor the one that Greek augury may have been influenced by it, is new. The chapter puts the case for these claims for bird oracles in the Hittite archives on a firmer footing. It establishes that Anatolian augury of the 2nd millennium BC is strongly Luwian in character. It looks at evidence for augury in the Near East. Finally, the chapter considers augury as reflected in Greek sources from the 1st millennium BC.
