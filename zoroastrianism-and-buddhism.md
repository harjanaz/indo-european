It has been claimed so by many, but the evidence is too circumstantial to be sure one way or the other. Both the Pali and Sanskrit traditions have features reminiscent of Zoroastrianism.
Pali tradition
The story of Mara tempting The Buddha on the night of his awakening is similar to that of Zoroaster being tempted by Ahriman. Some think this is not an accident and indicates cultural diffusion, from the Achaemenid or Parthian empires.
Sanskrit tradition
It is widely accepted academically (in the West) that the development of celestial Bodhisattvas and Buddhas happened partially due to the influence of Greek religion on Buddhism, in the Indo-Greek Kingdom of Gandhara. However, it is also speculated that Zoroastrianism may have played a role in this, in the cultural and religious melting pot that was the Kushan Empire.

BUT shared origin means that many shared stories might predate either set of traditions.
