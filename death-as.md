# Anglo-Saxon Death
In general
	· Perhaps the fire served to ensure that the spirit did not trouble the living, they ensured the continued spiritual welfare of the dead and the safety of the living
	· *whatever means, it ended with burial in the earth


Inhumation *afterlife much like on earth 
	 (Men needed their weapons (particularly spears) and women needed their jewelry and spinning equipment)
	· Popular in Saxon areas and Kent
	· Long and shallow  
	· Oriented N-S  (later the Christians turned it E-W)
	· Never in organized rows
	· Coffins were rare
	· No evidence of sacrifice?
	· Women decorated with jewelry (ex. headdresses, beads, crowns, etc.)
		○ If they lacked the finances then family would provide
		○ Crystal balls hung from waist
	· Men decorated with belt buckles and belt items (ex. knives, fire lighters) and had a shield and spear
		○ Young boys not given weapons
	· Both genders had amulets (ex. animal tooth, shells)
	· Children had 2 or 3 tiny beads around their necks
	· If it was a bad person: decapitation, strewing of flints/placing of stones over the body, and burning of corn were done to prevent the dead from troubling the living


Cremation *afterlife is different from on earth
	· Popular in Anglian areas
	· Pyre
		○ Body laid on ground or in shallow grave and pyre laid over them
	· Spears totally lacking (although a fancy sword and axe were found unburnt in two pyres)
	· The remains placed in urns and the urns buried in rows
		○ Widow-urns: had little glass windows, perhaps so the soul of the person could see out or leave the pot (but this would seem to contradict the meaning)
		○ Most had Tīr Rune designs (as well as: Ing, gyfu, ger, eþel, and sigel)
		○ Many had dragon designs, perhaps because dragons guard barrows/treasure
		○ Some had boar and horse designs (cult of Freyr)
		○ Wealthy people used rarer vessels (bronze bowls covered in elegant blankets)
	· Mounds placed over some, and perhaps as in Beowulf, warriors circled the mound and praised the dead
	· Horses sacrificed for men of high rank
	· Women play a big part
		○ Mothers and sisters gave orders for the disposal of the bodies 
		○ They uttered laments (--> Angel of Death)
	· Meaning:
		○ The fire caused a metamorphosis in which the spirit of the dead (and his possessions?) was apotheosized to some other plane 
		○ "It was a belief that the higher the smoke rose in the air, the higher would rise the man whose pyre it was; and the more goods that were destroyed with him, the richer he would be." (Snorri, Ynglinga)
	· See Beowulf boat pyre burial
		
		
Mixed method
	· Urns containing cremated bones were deposited among graves
	· In urban areas: *near rivers (i.e. close to settlements)
		○ Bodies were buried in graves, partly burnt
	· Likely due to different tribes coming together
		
		
Ship Funerals
	· For chiefs/kings
	1. Adrift at sea
		○ No physical evidence (probably because it could float away to foreign shores or wash ashore)
		○ Literary evidence: Scyld Scefing Fertility Myth (He arrived mysteriously by ship as a child, brought prosperity in his life, then departed by ship funeral)
	2. Adrift at sea and set on fire
		○ "The ship sailed blazing out to sea" (Snorri, Ynglinga Saga)
	3. Set on land (on a pyre)
		○ Common
	4. Set on land (buried in a mound) Sutton Hoo, in honor of King Rædwald
		○  Pit dug on the beach, ship placed in it, and a top-soil mound built on top (up to 20,00 cubic ft of material) The peak was not in the center, but on the eastern end
			§ Orientation: E-W (because that's the direction of the sea or symbolically?)
		
		○ Inner Ship Chamber 
			§ Floor was Carpeted
			§ No body, although there was an obvious place for a corpse and accompanying sword and belt/clasps (although placed in an awkward position) so this lead one to believe it was a cenotaph.  On the other hand, there were high phosphate levels, lead one to believe there was a body, but it was naked.
				□ Tapestry over body-area
			§ Items 
				□ placed in certain positions, H shape (domestic items were at the east end, ceremonial items at the west end, others in the middle)
				□ Buried with aurochs horns
				□ Whetstone scepter (8 faces, 4 male/female; with a stag's head at the top; knobs at each end colored blood red)
				□ A purse containing 37 Merovingian coins, 3 blank gold coins, and 2 small ingots
					® Probably a payment (coins for the 40 oars men, and the ingot perhaps for the oarsmen who would guide the king after death) *"paying the ferryman" is, as far as we know, only a Mediterranean practice, although we do see it in a small number of rich Frankish graves
	
'cunning women' had control of burial, a responsibility which is likely to have survived conversion (Geake). From The Cross Goes North Ed. Martin Carver
