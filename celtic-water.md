# *Celtic Water*

- "perceived as both a creator and destroyer of life."

- "The sanctity and symbolism of water continued into the Christian tradition."

- Rivers
  
  - "Rivers were regarded as a numinous life-force: from as early as the Bronze Age, people cast precious objects into them as votive offerings. In the Celtic Iron Age, rivers such as the Thames and Witham received particularly martial items...Rivers at their sources and confluences were especially holy. Condatis ('Watersmeet') was venerated in the Tyne-Tees region of north Britain, and 'Condate' at Lyon was the sacred site at the confluence of the great Rhône and Saône rivers. The personae of many rivers  were worshipped as named spirits: Sequana of the Seine; Souconna of the Saône; Verbeia of the Wharfe are just a few examples. The Insular Dinnshenchas relates the myth of the River Boyne, personified as the goddess Boann, who was turned into a river as punishment by her husband Nechtan, himself a water-spirit, for daring to visit his forbidden well (Sídh Nechtan)."

- Lakes and marshes and bogs
  
  - "The Classical writer Strabo testifies to the deposition of treasure in sacred lakes, and there is archaeological evidence for this practice. At the Swiss lake-site of La Tène, wooden platforms (some dated...to the second century BC) were specially built to facilitate the casting of precious objects into a small bay at the eastern end of Lake Neuchâtel. Offerings included hundreds of brooches, weapons and shields, chariots and animals, thrown in over a period which centered around 100 BC. in Wales the lake of Llyn Fawr in Mid Glamorgan was the centre of cult-activity in about 600 BC, when objects including antique cauldrons and exotic material of the style known as Hallstatt (from the type-site in Austria), were deposited. Llyn Cerrig Bach on Anglesey was a watery site into which had been cast many prestige objects, including chariots, weapons and cauldrons, over a period from the second century BC to the first century AD. It is possible that Llyn Cerrig was associated with the druids, described by the Roman writer Tacitus as having an important cult-centre on the Island of Mona."
  
  - "The repeated deposition of cauldrons is interesting. These vessels were traditionally associated with feasting and plenty...The Irish god the Daghda possessed an enormous, ever-replenishing cauldron; and the Welsh hero Brân gave a cauldron of rebirth to the Irish king Matholwch. Their function as containers for liquid may be the reason why they were so often deposited as sacred offerings in watery contexts. the great Danish Bra and Gundestrup Cauldrons were found in marshes; the Duchcov (Czechoslovakia) Cauldron came from a Celtic spring sanctuary and held more than 2000 items of bronze jewelry. Scottish lakes, such as Carlingwark Loch and Blackburn Mill, were the focus of ritual cauldron deposition in the very late Iron Age (early first century AD)."
  
  - "Bogs were the centre of important cult activity, not only because of their watery nature but also perhaps because of the element of danger and treachery associated with them. In the Celtic Iron Age the marsh-spirits were propitiated with offerings ranging from weapons, cauldrons and wagons to human sacrifice. The Scottish Torrs Chamfrein, an elaborate item of horse-armor, came from a marsh, as did the Gundestrup Cauldron and two cult-wagons from Dejbjerg in Denmark. The most spectacular marsh-offering from Britain was found at Lindow Moss, the body of a young man who was garroted and cast naked into a marsh-pool some time during the Iron Age."

- **Springs and Wells**
  
  - "Springs and wells were associated with...healing. **Wells...were perceived as a link between the earth and the Underworld**. The goddess Coventina presided over a sacred spring and well at the Roman fort of Carrawburgh on Hadrian's Wall. A Romano-British well at Goadby, Leicestershire, contained the bodies of two people, weighted down with stones, perhaps offerings to the [chthonic] powers. A dry well dating to the Roman period at Jordan Hill, Dorset, contained very curious and deliberately structured deposits, including stone cists filled with ironwork and sixteen pairs of tiles between each of which were the body of a crow and a coin. Sacred wells feature in Insular myths: the **Fionn Cycle described the Salmon of Knowledge which lived at the bottom of a well.** The cult of the Irish goddess Brigit...was closely associated with sacred wells. Many saints presided over holy wells: St Melor of Cornwall is an example. Saint Winifride's Well at Holywell in Clwyd is one of many in Wales. As is the case with the legend of the Welsh Saint Winifride, the severed heads of Breton saints endowed particular wells with sanctity and power."
  
  - "Springs were revered [for their] medicinal and purifying properties. In Romano-Celtic times powerful cults associated with healing springs attracted pilgrims from all over Celtic Europe. The two natural springs at Chamalières near Clermont-Ferrand possess minerals with genuine curative properties: in the first century BC and first century AD the sacred pool was visited by sick devotees who offered to the presiding spirit wooden images of themselves, displaying particularly eye-afflictions. In the same period a shrine at Fontes Sequanae (the Spring of Sequana) was established near Dijon, in veneration of the healing goddess of the Seine at its spring-source. More than 200 wooden models of pilgrims, or the parts of their bodies which required a cure, were dedicated to the goddess. Healing cults like this were based upon the principle of reciprocity: after bathing in the pure, sacred water of the spring, the devotee offered a model of a diseased limb or organ, in the hope that the deity would give back one that was whole and healthy."
  
  - "the Celtic Apollo presided over many of these sites...Apollo Belenus...was venerated at Sainte Sabine in Burgundy and elsewhere; Apollo Grannus, with his consort Sirona, was invoked at Grand (Vosges), but his shrines existed as far apart as Brittany and Hungary. Here...sick suppliants bathed, offered their gifts and then slept in a special dormitory, where they hoped for a vision of the healing god. Other...healers included Lenus Mars, a Treveran god whose main cult-centre was associated with a stream and spring near the Moselle at Trier. The greatest British curative deity was Sulis, whose sanctuary was at Aquae Sulis, the great temple at Bath, established on a...hot spring"
