## Proto-Afro-Asiatic
Black God
Julian Baldick
Proto-Afro-Asiatic
Aim: obtaining water
Gods:
Male Storm, Black ,and violent
Female sun, white, vulnerable; sacrificed to the Black god to bring rain, but then there's too much rain so the Black god is killed by the Younger male god
Younger Male god: fertilizing water itself, kills the Black god, then weds the Female sun goddess.
Christ "a source of 'living water' which will leave nobody thirsty (John 4:4-30). At the culmination of the Feast of Tabernacles he again offers to quench anyone's thirst, and declares that whoever belives in him will find streams of living water flowing from inside himself (John 7:37)."
 
Logic is dualistic, opposition between male and female (no neuter words)
Male: greatness, strength, prestige, energy, large houses, valuable animals (cattle)
Female: small, weak, lacking in prestige, passive. Mice. Inferior.
Semitic
God of Dark Violent Storm-Clouds and Rain (who, when killed, brings fertility)
"He who urinates" Rain Demon
Old (no family), All powerful, Infinitely rich 
Darkness, violence, terror
Killed by younger, Moon/Green god
Not 'astral religion' (the sun and mon are really just symbols of light and goodness, and the other stars are absent) 
Sacrifice of a pure young white/dove girl (sometimes daughter of the Black God) to bring fertility
 
Greece
The author asserts that the Greek intellectual focus on polarity/duality [and the Dualism of Iranian Mazdaism] is from Afroasiatic…. 
 
Ex. "Sacrificing an animal instead of one's own daughter"
Ex. "the…idea that a human consists of two elements, spirit of divine origin, and matter, is anticipated in ancient Akkadian epic. Thus the Greek obsession with antithesis, which we have seen in Herodotus and Plutarch…"
 
….expect Plato who resembled the IE functions:
Philosopher Kings (Reason)
Soldiers (Anger)
Wealth (Desire)
"After Plato tripartite structures continue to dominate the Greek philosophical tradition and help to keep it fundamentally at odds with the Afroasiatic legacy in Christianity and Islam. The neo-Platonist triad of the One, Reason and the Soul is central to the teachings of the Christian and Muslim mystics, who are confronted by legalistic opponents inspired by the Semitic inheritance." p.161
 
Modern Europe
"Pascal: 'Fire, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob. Not of the philosophers and of the scholars'…Pascal's thought is essentially an Afroasiatic rejection of philosophy and reason in the name of piety and the heart…a movement which sees Augustine as its main predecessor…typically…denial of free will in favor of predestination….Pascal's natural successor is…Kierkegaard…he rejects the dominant philosophy of his time (basically a continuation of neo-Platonism) because it tries to overcome opposites and reconcile them in a higher synthesis, whereas he wants their antagonism to be maintained. Moreover, like his fellow-existentialist Sadra, and like the Hausa with their 'universe without things', Kierkegaard has an insistence on constant 'becoming'…The strongest trace of the Afroasiatic inheritance…is to be found in…Freud…the relationship between the sexes…the opposition between successive generations and in particular between father and son. In Freud's work both of these aspects are combined to revive the ancient Afroasiatic myth of the killing of an old male figure by a young rival for his bride….his imaginative reconstruction of a primal horde in which the father kept all the women to himself. The father…would have been killed by his jealous sons, and this killing would have been re-enacted by sacrificing an animal representing him."
