## Middle Paleolithic

Middle of the Paleolithic or Stone age, 500k-200kBCE, Heidelberg Man, "first tenuous hints of what might possibly have been mythological conceptualization. It was then that symmetrical tools were crafted in sizes large enough to suggest ritual use, which prompted mythologist Joseph Campbell to hypothesize a 'mythology and ritual lore of the hand ax, which in later myth and cult because linked to the idea of thunder (Thor's hammer, the bolt of Zeus, Indra, etc.)' (Primitive, 393) From the same period are crudely formed triangular stone figures that Marija Gimbutas associates with an early stage of goddess mythology  (Language, 237)."
Neanderthal "excavations in the village of Le Moustier [had] whole skeletons or separated skulls...surrounded or covered by valuable objects such as bits f quartz and jasper, bone plates, and tools--perhaps supplies for survival in another world. The soil seems to have been colored by red ocher, suggesting a ceremonial approach to death. Some bodies appear to have been buried in fetal of sleeping positions, possibly indicating that death was seen as a sleeping period that might lead to new birth...(see, e.g., Narr, Paleolithic Religion; Campbell, Animals Powers). 
Neanderthal "bear sanctuaries in caves of the high Alps (Primitive, 339ff)...bear skulls are set into 'altar' niches, suggesting a worshiping of animal spirits and an early belief in the willing participation of animals in the life-giving process of killing and eating...Campbell sees the Neanderthal bear sanctuaries as the 'earliest evidence anywhere on earth of the veneration of a diving being'  and as an indication of ritual sacrifice (Animal powers, 147). For Campbell the bear sanctuaries were the source for bear cults that would spread across northern Europe and Asia into North America. In connection with these cults, particularly in light of the fact that, hibernation was a mystery for early humans--one augmented by the ability of the bear to stand and even walk upright like them--the question rises whether this bear 'god' was the first of many who seemed to die only to return to life later, who, if treated properly in a ritual context, would allow himself to be killed for the good of all?"

## Upper Paleolithic

"generally the female depictions occur in areas meant for dwelling, whereas the ritual hunting scenes are under the earth, available only to those who venture there for ritual purposes."
The Venus of Laussel "stands naked, her great maternal breasts reaching almost to a pronounced belly on which her left hand rests, calling attention to the navel and public triangle below. Meanwhile her right hand holds up what appears to be a symbolic object--and animal horn or, some have suggested, a crescent moon." ~I think horn
"A Venus in Morovia contains holes in its head that Campbell thinks may have been put there to hold plants and feathers relating to ceremonies of fertility and growth (Animal Powers, 70)"
