#### Premigration vs Migration
Wirth sees a development or metamorphosis from a pre-migratory era PIE "Agni-Frey" (called the "Child or Son of Heaven & Earth") to a migratory-era  "Indra-Thor". This later is a battle & death god. Odin is post migratory and is the god of warriors and the safe-conductor of the warrior's souls.
