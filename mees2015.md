## Abstract
> The bronze figurine from Frøyhov bears a short and difficult early runic text which seems to represent some sort of name. First published in the late nineteenth century, the inscription may most regularly be interpreted as Inga(n)da, a form which features the early Germanic onomastic element *ing‑. Germanic *ingseems best to be etymologised as a reflex of IE *h 2 neḱ-/h 2 nenḱ- ‘reach, attain’ and the Frøyhov form taken either to be a maker’s inscription or a theonym, the figurine itself clearly representing a religious expression.
