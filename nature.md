## Quotes
> We entered Kamiko Ì„chi and greeted the Hodaka mountain peaks in the morn- ing. Leaves of larch and birch are reflecting the morning sun and it is like looking at a scroll painting. I found my absolute authority here. If man did not possess a political nature, I would not mind sacrificing my life for this absolute authority [beauty and nature].  Sasaki Hachiro (Kamakaze Pilot)
