# Nominal Case Usage
Endings are morphological features. They have *Karaka* meanings, and *prepositional* meanings. This is why you see bahiḥ “outside” (indeclinable which takes Abl). The karaka usage is not itself clear either, 
you can find:
rātrau “during the night” which is in Locative!
becase the locative can be temporal
