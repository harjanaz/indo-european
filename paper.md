# Introduction
The Ontological Turn (TOT) is a movement that began in the 90s to start considering ontology more than epistemology. Its members share the core desire to understand and "take more seriously" the Other. From what I have been able to gather there are essentially: two kinds of Others that TOT has addressed (the non-human and the non-western); two disciplines it has drawn from (Philosophy and Anthropology); and finally two forms of the movement's "seriousness" (what I will call "hard" and "soft", the form is a metaphysics the later a method). Often these things are mixed. For example, Holbraad's original Anthropological work in 2007 asked "hard" ontological questions about non-western and non-human objects. In 2017 Holbraad took a more "soft" position and also considered western Christians.  Over the next few pages I will do my best to lay out: a summary of the movement, Holbraad's place in it, its predecessors in our readings (Phenomenology and William James), and finally its implications for the discipline.

# Part 1 - Summary

One branch of the TOT addresses the non-human, which can range from office staplers to monkeys. Whatever the entity the goal is to try to take them "seriously" (2017: 199) and ask "What's it like to be a --  anyways?". The scholars of this vein include: the various post-Heideggerian Object Oriented Ontologists, the Post-Humanists, some Ecological Anthropologists (like Kohn 2013 who asked "do forests think?"), some Animal Rights activists, Alfred Gell (who prescribed objects a certain kind of agency), Latour (who prescribed object-human constructs like a "human-with-gun" with responsibility), Tim Ingold (who "sees humans and things as submerged on an equal ontological footing in ‘an ocean of materials’"; Holbraad & Pedersen 208), and Ian Bogost (who developed a whole "alien phenomenology"). Some of these thinkers are "soft" and assert that non-humans are only somewhat conscious, others are "hard" and assert a full blown psycho-physical or dual-aspect metaphysics. We will see this division again when we look at the non-western Other. We will also address the movements connections to phenomenology in part two. For our purposes, the most relevant thinkers are Viveiros de Castro (1998) and Holbraad (2007 & 2017). Castro elucidated Amerindian Perspectivism, wherein animals share our culture (i.e. have minds like us) but are physically different from our perspective. Holbraad and his fellow editors in 2007 tried to eliminate the distinction between person and thing all together by asserting that things equal concepts. In 2017 Holbraad and Pedersen soften their position and admit that materiality can actually suggest conceptions (eg. the shape of Mongolian shrouds) rather than trying to argue that concepts create reality. 


The other branch of the TOT addresses the non-western Other (ex. indigenous peoples). The question they ask in this case is "How do I deal with things I encounter in the field which are unfamiliar to me, and/or challenge my concepts?" or more simply "How do I reconcile my ontology with theirs?"

Whatever "Other" OTers are addressing (non-human or non-western), it is difficult to summarize the answers OTers give because: (a) there are many individual thinkers in the movement with their own ideas about it, (b) these thinkers read each other differently (Laidlaw 2017, 398), (c) at least one of these thinker's ideas changed over time, and finally (d) the members use words like "epistemology" and "ontology" in ways that are fundamentally different from the way it is employed in Philosophy (Graeber 2015, 15; Heywood, 2012: 144). Never the less, from this point on in the Summary section we will mainly be talking about the development of the branch of TOT which addresses the non-human because it is that one in which has received the most attention.

There are many thinkers and smaller movements who make up the background to the non-western branch. The include: Philippe Descola (beyond nature, universal scope), Bruno Latour (modes of existence, experimental realism), STS / Actor-Network Theory, Roy Wagner, and most importantly Eduardo Viveiros de Castro (Amerindian perspectivism, fundamental alterity). In 1998 Viveiros de Castro argued that the Western concept of "Nature vs Culture" is inadequate to understand Amerindian perspectivism.  In part he was responding to Asad's call to "pay attention to the way in which anthropological knowledge is objectified, and especially to the ‘rationality of the world power which the West represents'" (Hazarika 2018, 138). In part he was trying to "reinvigorate structuralism by addressing the nature of the mentality of natural beings (Bessire & Bond 2014, 443). He showed how to Amerindian animals blood looks like a cup of wine, rotting flesh a feast. Their ontology is the inverse of ours: many natures one culture, not one nature many cultures. By bringing to attention Indigenous Ontologies they are put on the same level as the western ontology. He calls for "ontological self-determination".

Yet the movement wasn't really given a label until Henare, Holbraad, and Wastell came out with the collection *Thinking Through Things* in 2007.  The Introduction has been read most often as a call for a pluralistic ontology in which each culture has its own world. It has been called "the most radical relativism yet invented in anthropology. It permits no ground from which to theorize about culture as a whole or to claim an understanding of particular cultures beyond that which the informants themselves give. Rather it simply tries to penetrate these views and to understand them by way of contrast to other relativized views. Thus it does not reject comparison...[...]...Viveiros de Castro suggests that these points of difference are set in such radically different worlds that all we will be able to do is to talk past one another in a kind of “controlled equivocation”" (Meneses 2018, 29). The literalness with which the first generation of "hard" TOT takes ethnographic statements is a kind of return to the "Frazerian tendency in anthropology to explain beliefs about magic as ontological statements about reality" (Heywood, 2012: 145). The actual articles in the 2007 volume do not necessarily follow these  ideas (Fontein, 2020: 4).  Additionally, "the language [in the Introduction] often seems to slip back and forth between the subjunctive “as if” and simple declarative" (Graeber 2015, 20). Part of this is due to the difficulty of the ideas involved, part due to the somewhat performative style of writing, and part due to one of the thinkers: Holbraad.  In 2015 he admitted that:

> "...in this kind of post PhD, trying-to-impress-everyone-mode we said that there's this quiet revolution and its called "The Ontological Turn". But of course it's slightly ridiculous. Anyways, I spent the next ten years trying to think: "Ok, why is it "ontological"? Is it a "turn"?" (0:34 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-SQBe-V7Jw)

If  "ontology" is read as literally "reality/being" then what is being talked about is a "hard" turn to a meta-ontology of pluralism where worlds exist side by side creating a "bloated universe" (Heywood, 2012: 146). The ethnographer is told to take the informant's statements of belief literally, meaning that hard OT purposes a reality in which language generates realities. This is how many people originally read it and even if it is a misreading, so many people read it that way, and it is such a fascinating idea, that it is an undeniable part of the movement. If this is not what was actually intended, what is really meant by "ontology"? 

In 2015 Viveiros de Castro answers by saying "Maybe yes, maybe no. We’re trying. It depends on how you use the word". It absolutely means something more than just culture, because it explicitly relativizes nature as well. Culture to Viveiros de Castro is a "a poor man’s ontology" (2015: 9-10). He also raises the question of whether TOT is like William James' multiverse concept (which we will return to later). He doesn't outright answer this and leaves the reader even more confused when he says: "Magical powers, as the Merina conceive them, cannot exist... The so-called ontological turn is nothing more than a change in the disciplinary language-game..."(Viveiros de Castro, 2015: 13).

In 2017 Holbraad (& Pedersen) returned to clearly assert his own second generation or "soft"--my term--version (Holbraad & Pedersen, 2017) in which he spends a great deal of time trying to differentiate it from everything else people call "The Ontological Turn". The soft version is "ontological" not a meta-ontology, its a research method, not a theory. It "asks ontological questions without taking ontology (or indeed ontologies) as an answer" and it is "not concerned with what the ‘really real’" (Holbraad & Pedersen, 2017: ix-x). The book spends a great deal of time talk about Marilyn Strathern, for no apparent reason, and misreads Viveiros.  In the end the movement is reduced to a modest call to "stay open to new ideas" and "don't go in with a theory". This is a good method of epistemological openness, but certainly not an ontology.  The authors even go so far as to say what they are talking about is something which has always been done in Anthropology (just not to the degree) (2017: x).  One reviewer made the following judgment: "In general, Holbraad and Pedersen’s task throughout this book would have been a good deal easier, one feels, if they could have dropped the label ‘ontological’ entirely, and instead used one of the ideas for which this book shows infinitely more confident enthusiasm: why not the ‘reflexive’, ‘experimental’ or ‘conceptual turn’?" (Laidlaw, 2017: 399). Critics were predictably unsatisfied and Holbraad has even been accused of a "lack of courage" (Fontein, 2020: 8) and "self-exculpation" (Laidlaw, 2017: 396). 

I think a larger issue than Holbraad's change in direction is the fuzziness of the ideas involved, whether first generation or second generation, hard or soft. Anthropology has a tendency to be philosophically garbled--Peter Skafish describes it as a "poorly mixed, difficult-to-swallow cocktail" (2013)--and TOT is no exception. 

First, OTers change the definition of "ontology".  In 2007 it meant something like "verbally expressed concepts" about one's "way/manner of being"  (Graeber, 2015: 14-23).  Later in 2017, Holbraad's explicitly redefined it as something not "deep", not "fundamental", not "philosophical", not concerned with "ultimate reality"--in other words not ontology (Holbraad & Pedersen 2017: 10, 11, 15). Instead it is a way of thinking about things, or, imagining a word which "might be" (10.) It operates "always as an adjective or adverb -- never as a noun!" (11). The OT is "to ask ontological question without taking ontology as an answer" (11). Here is a simple example. The Maori *taonga* is usually translated as a "gift". There's a problem:  *taonga* also contain spirits, which "gifts" in the Western world do not. A simple solution is to call them *taonga* without translating. But OTers have a different solution. "Hard" OTers would say *taonga* exist in a different world which has different rules.  "Soft" Holbraad & Pedersen in 2017 say we should be open to reflexively change *our* conceptions/ontology to fit Maori conceptions/ontology (14). in this way the ethnographer starts to question their own definitions of "gifts", "spirits", "time" (think Eliade), etc. This kind of extreme reflexivity was influenced by Strathern and in turn by Radcliffe-Brown (Holbraad & Pedersen, 2017: 27). In this way too, the field transforms from something onto which one applies theory, into the source of theoretical inspiration.

Second, another reason TOT is fuzzy is that--in an attempt to overcome  colonial "western" ideas--they completely throw out dualist philosophy (i.e. Scholastics, Kant, Descartes, Nature/Culture, Body/Mind, etc), leaving the thinker in a philosophical twilight zone.  Ironically in the end you end up with: (1) a dualism of the modern west vs the indigenous other [footnotes: "What is surprising is how little this irony seems to matter to many self-appointed ontologists." (Bessire & Bond, 2014: 443)] ; and (2) a radical form of Idealism where reality is equated with thoughts and carried through language.


What is important for our purposes is that the movement tries to center the ethnographic experience on language and ontology rather than epistemology or after-the-fact analysis.  This could be "soft", in which case the ethnographer stays open to changing their assumptions and concepts during ethnography. Or, it could be "hard" in which case the ethnographer should assume that the Other culture exists in its own world and therefore shouldn't be interpreted, only compared with their own. In other words, the differences between us and them shouldn't be reconciled.  Instead, we should literally leave them be, accepting radical alterity and incommensurability. This "hard" kind of hyper-cultural relativism and philosophical strangeness is what in part made the movement originally so exciting. 


The focus on language allows ethnographers to realize that when they are confront, say, with magical powder, it isn't "powder that is magical" but literally "powder = magic". 



# Part 2 - Predecessors
## Post-Movement & Phenomenology
How is TOT related to the "Post-" movement and Phenomenology of the 80s and 90s? It some ways it grew with them, and in other ways it broke from them (Holbraad & Pedersen, 2017: 283-4; Ortner, 1984). From what I can gather they--whether through deconstructing, subjectivising, or relativising--all share a critical view of objectivity, and they locate reality largely it in the eye of the beholder.  However, there are many differences. 

First, unlike the "Post-" movement TOT (hard or soft) doesn't deconstruct to infinity. Instead, it brackets judgment. It's not a battle, its a truce. It is akin to Carol Christ's call in the late eighties for adding a second ethos to the academy.  On top of the "ethos of objectivity" she imagines an "ethos of eros" (Christ, 1987: 53-64) to balance it out. However, there are major differences between Christ and TOT. Christ was only speaking of theoretical ethoi (like the soft OT), while the hard OT is talking about realities. Christ's ethoi are limited to two, rooted in the gendered experience of being male or female, while TOT asserts an infinite number which can also be created simply by talking about them (i.e. by language).

Second, while there are certain thinkers in the "non-human" branch of TOT whose work is explicitly Phenomenological (e.g. Bogost's non-human "alien phenomenology"), the "non-western" branch does sit as well with it. This is due to language entering the picture. While the non-human OT and Phenomenology both try to get behind language, concepts, and representations to the pure experience, non-western OT focuses on language to the point that reality is identified not with objectivity, or even non-linguistic concepts, but with language itself. This is because of TOT's desire to take the word of the informant so seriously.

Are these differences positive developments?  The first (i.e. going beyond the "Post-" movement's negativity) certainly is. It allows the ethnographer or religious scholar to suspend questions of truth and dive into the thought of the person they are trying to understand. Now, while the second (i.e. TOT's attitude to language) provides a certain looseness and adaptability to one's definitions, if ultimately traps one inside of language. It is incapable of incorporating non-linguistic aspects of culture like ritual without an informant to rely upon to explain them.


## William James
Viveiros de Castro mentioned William James' multiverse concept in passing  when talking about predecessors to TOT (2015).  We encountered James in Bellah's book as well when he was talking about the differences between the world of play and the world of work, as well as the difference between the way we see heat (warmth) and the way scientists see it (as molecular vibrations). In a footnote he went on to say: 

> ...James speaks of multiple “realities” and “worlds” interchangeably. Schutz, at the beginning of his famous essay “Multiple Realities,” [1945] acknowledges James as the source of his terminology. For James, however, realities are subjective, whereas in Schutz’s phenomenological approach they are intersubjective. James is concerned with mental realities, Schutz with realities that are also cultural. In general, however, James’s insistence on “pluralism” was as much ontological as it was psychological.

Let us explore what Bellah and James were talking about, exactly, and how it links up with TOT.  As we saw in James' essay "The Will to Believe" (1897) he rooted his belief in Free Will not in scripture or logic but in his *experience* of an intentionally sustained thought. "James wanted a philosophy that rested on experience, not logic, because life exceeds logic" (Graeber, 2015: 23). Seven years earlier, in *The Principles of Psychology*--which Bellah cited--James tried to delineate the variety of experiences one can have (what he calls "sub-universes of meaning") (1890: 283– 322). These include:

> (1) The world of sense...
(2) The world of science, or of physical things as the learned conceive them...
(3) The world of ideal relations...
(4) The world of 'idols of the tribe,' illusions or prejudices...
(5) The various supernatural worlds...
(6) The various worlds of individual opinion, as numerous as men are.
(7) The worlds of sheer madness and vagary, also indefinitely numerous."

When we encounter something new, it gets categorized in one of these worlds. As James puts it: "Every object we think of gets at last referred to one world or another of this or of some similar list". But as Bellah pointed out these worlds were purely subjective. They exist in the individual's mind, not in culture. Alfred Schütz's later reinterpreted of them as "inter-subjective" is a bit closer to what the soft OT now calls "conceptions", but even then Schütz's view was phenomenological, not ontological. We have to look later in James' life to find the real parallels to TOT. As time went by James started to take personal experience more and more seriously.  Two years later in 1899 he wrote a little essay titled "On a certain blindness in human beings" in which he addressed the fact that people perceive things differently from one another.  Three years later he turned his gaze to religion in his *The Varieties of Religious Experience* (1902). In his later works he started to call his philosophy "pragmatism", "pluralism", and "radical empiricism".  While he first tries to reconcile monism and pluralism in his 1907 work *Pragmatism*, he eventually laid down a truly pluralistic metaphysics in his 1909 *A Pluralistic Universe*. 

***Goodman (2012: 157-8) summed up James' variable use of "pluralism" as follows: "James began using the term as a synonym for metaphysical indeterminism, but soon expanded its employment to other metaphysical doctrines, for example, that the world is composed of no one system, and that it is a series of unique particulars. He also used it for the epistemological claims that no account of the world and no point of view can take it all in; and for a series of ethical and political views based on a radical individualism. These doctrines all cohere with James’s basic vision of an open, multifaceted universe within which human action sometimes makes a real difference." ***

He, like the OTers, sought to go beyond modern materialism and dualism (Slater, 2011: 71). By rooting belief in personal experience, he concluded that the universe exists "solely in the each-form" (Slater, 2011: 71). Connolly called James' universe a "messy universe" (2005: 70). Heywood (2012: 146) similarly called the hard OT's universe a "bloated universe". But unlike some hard OTers, James was speaking of only humans and so he wasn't talking about nearly as many universes. Like the OTers James tried to keep his horizons open. He did not insist on the truth of all his beliefs. His writings are dotted with the word "may". For example he said: "The world may in the last resort be a block-universe; but on the other hand it may be a universe only strung along, not rounded in or closed." And on his pluralism he said: "...acting thus may in certain special cases be a means of making it securely true in the end." So apparently like for the hard Oters who maintain that language generates ontology, James thinks that action may generate reality. Or at least just like the soft Oters "you make the experience of pluralism more 'securly true' by acting experimentally in several domains as if it were true" (Connolly, 2005: 80-1). This is the ultimate Jamesian "Will to Believe".
 
All of this reminds me of TOT so much, that I wonder if the thinkers were directly influenced by James, even though they don't mention him apart from a couple brief namedroppings. Now, both the Oters and James are difficult to interpret. Their language is loose and inexact because they are trying to imagine things outside the proverbial box. I, nor anyone else, can say for sure what James meant. It would take more space than I have to do him justice. But like with the hard OT, people have certainly read James' "multiple realities" as I have.








# Part 3 - Implications
## ...for the History of Religion
Oters (hard or soft) have rarely considered the past. The "Others" they have been concerned with exist primarily in the present. The classicist Greg Anderson is one exception. Recently in light of TOT he has tried to apply a kind of "ontological history" to the "vanished lifeworld" of ancient Athens (Anderson, 2015: 806; 2018). Essentially he treated source authors as if they were ethnographic informants. By throwing out his own Western assumptions about religion, democracy, and citizenship, he was able to express how the Athenian would have seen his world. What he found was that *demokratia* in its original sense meant that the male citizens (*demos*) were sons of the primordial earth goddess of the *polis*, not merely secular voters in our sense of the word. Anderson argued that by first understanding a group;s fundamental ontology a historian could go on to tackle topics like economics or political comparison in a more faithful way. The only other example I can find of such "ontological history" is Bauschatz's 1982 classic *The Well and the Tree: World and Time in Early Germanic Culture*. Bauschatz of course came before TOT, but his attentiveness to words related to "being" helped other Germanicists interpret various aspects of Norse and Anglo-Saxon literature.  For scholars who are interested in linguistic and cultural reconstruction, the TOT could help uncover the ontology of prehistoric peoples by working backwards from attested languages. What would make this different from regular "Indo-European Studies", for example, is that instead of considering mere vocabulary or narrative poetics it would first layout the ontology of various historical branches (Athenian, Germanic, etc) and then compare them to find common ontological aspects. In this way ontologies, and their transformation, could be mapped through time. Its somewhat like Lévi-Strauss's comparisons, but more attentive to language and ontology. Without knowing it at the time, I had done something akin to this in my own undergraduate thesis when I tried to understand the prehistorical ontological status of the invisible dead. 

## ...for Religious "Religious Studies" Scholars
> Implications for RS scholars: here, I think you need to offer more of an argument for why theological, positive religious belief and religious accounts of the real are important to be included in RS scholarship and what you think would be lost by overlooking these insights/perspectives or by creating such expansive relativism that all of these truth claims operate without interaction. It is clear you are concerned by this state of affairs but you don’t give much of an explanation why. Making that concern explicit would be helpful and interesting. 

For Religious Studies scholars who are personally religious, Jamesian pluralism (Aho, 2017) and/or the "hard" reading of TOT may seem promising. The later "levels the playing field between secular or atheist and religious notions of what is and isn’t real, and 2) it opens the door for religious anthropologists to incorporate theology into their work of understanding the human condition and be taken seriously" (Meneses 2018, 29). 

What Meneses doesn't account for however, is that secular Religious Studies scholars will simply respond by saying "alright you can incorporate theology, but only inside your own world, a world which we put on the shelf with the rest of the non-scientific worlds". In other words, while TOT permits differences in opinion, belief, and indeed reality, it doesn't allow these differences to interact in any way, leaving everyone in their own box.  If everyone is in their own box, then there is no standard for scholarship.  The academy could end up with poor scholarship, or--as the Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth put it--"proximity can be perilous – we risk losing our compass, getting too close and ‘going native’" (ASA 2014). This desire to maintain a secular distance from religion, while simultaneously studying it, was what created Religious Studies in the first place. 

Perhaps 'going native' is actually desirable. As the anthropologist Zoe Todd puts it: 

"...ostensibly, Indigenous thinkers cannot maintain objectivity when working with our own political, legal and intellectual concerns. Apparently, to be seen as credible in the European academy, Indigenous thought must be filtered through white intermediaries. Trusty interpreters, usually male, usually middle class, can birth Indigenous thinking into the mainstream. In other words: the revolution will be mediated".

Todd explicitly supports Holbraad's and Viveiros de Castro’s "call for the ‘permanent decolonization of thought’" but she believes that "the academic structures through which this decolonisation of thought is being carried out continue to reproduce the white supremacy of the academy"  and to perpetuate "the exploitation of Indigenous peoples" (Todd, 2011: 16). Todd has written about how she has been unable to come to terms with the fundamental "euro-western cosmologies, ontologies, and epistemes" of the academy, and has apparently left it altogether (Todd, 2018, 2020).

For deeply christian scholars there are private universities for them to go to, but many Indigenous peoples simply don't have that kind of institutional option. Without the secularism, materialism, and dualism which more or less bind the Academy together with a common ontology (nature/culture, armchair/field, theory/method), the Academia could end up falling apart, balkanizing until it breaks. What started as a call to take the Other more seriously could end with everyone at each other's throats.


## ...for Policy regarding Religion
When it comes to governmental policy, TOT is a mixed bag. According to Viveiros de Castro TOT becomes a tactic of cultural "war" a "philosophical war machine" (Viveiros de Castro, 2015: 9). One the one hand the "hard" forms of TOT could help protect indigenous religions by asserting the reality of non-human beings like rivers. Indeed in various countries (New Zealand, etc) rivers have been deemed legal persons (in a move called "Environmental personhood").

On the other hand TOT in its "hard" reading has been criticized for essentializing cultures. It's form of hyper-cultural-relativism leaves communities in a pickle. How are these worlds generated? Who creates them? Who is allowed to judge what constitutes one? The answer is either anarchy or intellectual totalitarianism. Holbraad and the Oters have been accused of creating a system which can be used to protect conservative Western ideas and which will create "new regimes of inequality or...conditions for the hypermarginality of supposedly insufficient or "decultured" Indigenous populations (Graeber, 2015: 7-10, 33; Bessire & Bond, 2014: 445).
