## Proto Words
When I can I use conventional translations for PIE words, like "fame" for `*ḱléwos`. When multiple terms are grouped I try to use Buck's semantic fields.

## Citations
If you want MLA, Chicago, etc just go to the doi or jstor link. They have them all. [Crossref](https://search.crossref.org/) works wonders.
