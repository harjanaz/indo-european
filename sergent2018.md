## Abstract
> Three myths from Western Eurasia share many similarities, the most notable being the killing of a bull after the decision of a goddess, who had not foreseen it. The paper examines the reports of these three myths (those of Ištar in Mesopotamia, Dionysus in Greece, Medb in Ireland) and shows that those of Greece and Ireland are, independently of each other, linked to the Mesopotamian myth. The explanation for this relationship lies in the Neolithic expansion from Syria-Palestine.
