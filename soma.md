### Barley
[Barley](barley.md) migt have been part of the soma mixture, and is what the other sacred drink [surā](sura.md) (likely the pre-soma ritual drink) was made from. In RV 8.2.3 barley is even identified with soma.

### PIE Myth: Non-Invitation to Soma Party
- When Tvastr held a soma-drinking rite at his home, he did not invite Indra. This is because Indra had previously killed Tvastr’s son, the three-headed Visvarupa, in an earlier soma-related altercation. Indra turned up anyway and forcibly drank the soma, causing some disturbance in proceedings. Indeed, there would seem to be a parallel with the Norse God Loki here, who, in a story in the Poetic Edda, is not invited to join in drinking mead with the gods in the mead-hall, leading to a similarly awkward situation.

- Is Eris & the Wedding of Paris and Helen apart of this?
- Sleeping Beauty (maleficient, birth party)
- Chinese zodiac? How they chose the animals of the Zodiac?
