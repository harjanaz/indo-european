[[pie]]

---

"Peri-Indo-European" is Giacomo Devoto's Term for hybrid ([[pie]] + [[non-ie]]) languages, peoples, and cultures. 
It was produced when traditions alien to the Indo-European were progressively altered by contact with the Indo-European. 

## Etruscans
Devoto proposed and repeatedly supported the definition of the [Etruscan language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan-language "Etruscan language") as Peri-Indo-European.
