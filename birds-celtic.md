o "the human spirit freed at death"
o "Their distinctive 'voices' may have led to the oracular associations of ravens and doves."
o "Water-birds may have been seen as a symbolic link between sky and water."
o "The alert and protective character of geese led to their symbolic connection with war."
o "In both Irish and Welsh tradition, magical birds, usually in threes, were associated with healing and rebirth in the Otherworld. The bright-plumaged birds of the Irish goddess Clíodna and the birds of the Welsh Rhiannon could lull the sick to sleep with their sweet song."
o "Cranes were important in Irish myth: those belonging to Midhir were birds of ill omen, whose presence robbed warrior of their courage. Ill-natured or jealous women were punished by being changing into cranes: this idea may have come about because the crane's raucous shriek was likened to the screech of a scold. The Irish sea-god Manannán possessed a bag made from the skin of a crane which had once been a jealous woman. That cranes or egrets were significant also in Gaulish religion is demonstrated by the curious iconography of Tarvostrigaranus, the 'Bull with Three Cranes', depicted on stones at Paris and Trier dating from the first century AD."
o "As eaters of carrion and with their black plumage, crows and ravens were particularly associated with death. Irish war-goddesses such as the Morrigán and Badbh could assume crow-form and appear on the battlefield as harbingers of disaster. In Insular myth the prophetic associations of ravens were usually related to the foretelling of evil. Ravens and crows were important symbols in pagan European iconography, but here they seem to have been linked to beneficent deities, like Nantosuelta, Epona and the healers, perhaps as prophets of good fortune. Ritual involving ravens occurred in the British Iron Age: at Danebury and Winkleburg in Hampshire, bodies of ravens were deliberately buried in pits, perhaps as sacrifices to the [chthonic] powers."
o "Other birds which were important in myth included eagles and swans…the eagle was associated…with sky-symbolism. In welsh myth the eagle in linked with Lleu Llaw Gyffes, perhaps a god of light. Irish myth abounds in stories of enchanted swans, which spend some time as birds and some as girls: stories about Midhir and Étain, Oenghus and Caer and Cú Chulainn all carry descriptions of magical swans wearing gold and silver chains, apparently a mark of their supernatural status. In one myth the children of Lir (a sea-god) are cursed with swan-shape for 900 years because of the jealousy of their stepmother. The particular association of swans with lovers may derive from the observation that swans mate for life.
