## Description
> Trepanation (trepanning) was a kind of ancient medical surgery practiced in the Early Bronze Age of Northern Europe. You might be familiar with the famous trepanation of skulls in the Americas, specifically trepanning in Mesoamerica and most famously perhaps in the Andes but trepanning is seen throughout Neolithic Europe too and continues into the Bronze Age and beyond. A number of trepanned skulls were discovered in the megalithic tombs of the Neolithic peoples of northern Europe and were long assumed to belong to the people who built them. New evidence shows that isn't the case and they are from a later period. So who do they belong to and what can it tell us about violence, medical practices and ancient surgery in Early Bronze Age Europe?
