Scandinavian topography is not characterized by purely geographical co-ordinates; it is permeated by emotional, religious, and mythic sense.

***veröld*** = *verr* 'man' + ***öld*** 'age' (related to *ala* 'to bear or rear')

A 24 hour period was known as a *sólarhringr* 'sun-ring' or 'sun-course' and consisted of the the visible movements of the sun. 

- It was divded into two 12 hour parts each called *dægr* which was used to indicated both the night and the day. You know which it refers to based on context. Hence: *i degi dægr tvau, i dægri stundir tolf* 'in a day two *dægr*, in a *dægr* 12 hours'.

- It was divded into eight parts called *áttir* or *dagsmörk*. 
  
  - ***áttir***  Each 3 hours. A dægr consisted of 4 a*áttir*.) They were named after the cardinal directions: *norðr átt* (N), *landnorðr* (NE), *austr* (E), *landsuðr* (SE), *suðr* (S), *útsuðr* (SW), *vestr* (W), and *útnorðr* (NW). They were based on Norwegian geography (hence west = out). Each *áttir* = 45º of a circle, hence if you wanted to say exactly west you would need to say *í vestr miðiu* 'in the middle of the west', but they also refered to this using day marks. 
  
  - ***dagsmörk***  A mix of sun-locations and social-events. Specific times:
    
    - 6am        *rismál* 'hour or rising';  *miðr-morgun* 'mid-morning' (E)
    
    - 9am        *dag-mál* 'day-meal' (SE)
    
    - 12pm      *hádegi* 'high-day';  *miðdegi* 'mid-day' (S)
    
    - 3pm        *undorn* 'mid-afternoon meal';  *nón* 'nine' (from latin *nona*) (SW)
    
    - 6pm        *miðr-aptan* 'mid-evening' (W)
    
    - 9pm        *nátt-mál* 'night-meal' (NW)
    
    - 12am      *mið-nætti* 'midnight' (N)
    
    - 3am        *ótta* 'the last part of the night' (NE)

So what you have is a flat static horizontal (cardinal directions), and a rotating verticle circle, which have social (meal time) conotations and together compose the cosmos. Time, Space, and Society converge. We can see this in place names originating in locations called *eyktarmörk* hich were buildings or piles or rocks (anything really) which indicated a time of day when the sun was a above it.

Fun fact:  The sun was said to be *skaft-há* 'shaft-high' when it could be seen over a vertically placed shaft. 

##### Night

At night, certain stars were 'leading stars', for example, Arcturus which was known as *dagstjarna* 'day-star' or *stjarna* 'the star'.

##### Weeks

Weeks were defined in relation to the year and not to the lunar month.

- Sun       *sunnudagr*

- Mon     *mánadagr*

- Tues     *Týsdagr*

- Weds   *Óðinsdagr*

- Thurs   *þórsdagr*

- Fri        *Frjádagr*       'Frey's-day'

- Sat       *laugardagr*   'washing-day'

##### Year

The solar year was called *sólargangr* 'the course of the sun'.  1y = 52w = 364d = 2 half years.  Actually the primary unit was the half year (*misseri*), not the year (*ar* 'harvest').  They were *sumar* 'summer' & *vetr* 'winter', each 26w.  Similar bitpartitions of the year are known from a variety of societies Nilsson1920p86 among them the Celts Rees1976p84.  The period around the first summer (*Sumarmál* 'summer-meal') & winter day (*vetr-nætr*) were festive occasions. Summers started on Thursdays (between the 9th and 15th or April; except when *rímspillir* occured it fell on the 8th of April) and winters on Saturdays (between the 11th and 18th or October).  Winter = 6m;  Summer = 6m + additional days *auknætr*.  It was the duty of the *lögsögumaðr* 'lawspeaker' at the Althing, and the *goði* 'chiefs' for the upcoming *leið* 'autumn thing', to fiigured it all out and announced it each year.

#### Months

*mánuðr* 'month; moon' (on the possibility of an originally lunar calendar see Guðmundsson1924p89)

Most of their names have economic or agricultural meanings:

###### Summer

- APRIL ***sumar***;  ***gaukmánuðr*** 'cuckoo-month'; ***sáðtið*** 'seed-time'; ***harpa***

- MAY ***eggtið*** 'egg-time';  ***stekktið*** 'lamb-fold-time';  ***skerpla***

- JUNE ***sólmánuðr*** 'sun-month';  ***selmánuðr*** 'shieling month'.

- JULY ***miðsumar***;  ***heyannir*** 'hay-time';

- AUG ***heyannir*** 'hey-time'; ***tvímánuðr*** 'double-month';  ***kornskurðarmánaðr*** 'corn-cutting-month

- SEP ***kornskurðarmánuðr*** 'corn-cutting-month';  ***haustmánuðr*** 'harvest-month'

###### Winter

- OCT ***gormanuðr*** 'slaughtering month' 

- NOV ***ylir*** (cognate with *yule*);  ***frermánuðr*** 'frost-month'

- DEC ***jólmanoðr***; ***mörsugr*** 'fat-sucker'; ***hrútmánaðr*** 'ram-month'

- JAN ***þorri***; ***miðvetr***

- FEB ***gói***
