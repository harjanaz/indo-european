# Brig
Bríg [BREEGH, the ‘gh’ is a soft ‘g’ sound in the back of the throat; anglicized as Brigid; it is not spelled or pronounced BREED or BRIDE, which are modern Irish or Anglicized versions of the name). She is the daughter of the Dagda, and mother of Bres, whose unworthy kingship is enumerated in Cath Maige Tuired. In the 9th century source Sanas Chormaic (Cormac’s Glossary) she is described as a goddess of poetry, who, along with her two sisters also named Brig, were goddesses of healing and of smithcraft. This triplicism is a huge part of the Celtic spiritual and symbolic tradition, which they inherited from their Indo-European ancestors and antecedents (and does not reflect the modern notion of ‘Maiden, Mother, Crone,’ a creative and non-historical theory first postulated by the poet and Classics scholar Robert Graves in his 1949 work, ‘The White Goddess.’) Cormac’s Glossary states that Brigid was very beloved by the poets, because ‘very great was her protective care.’ Brigid only appears in a few short episodes in the Early Irish materials, where, for example, she was said to have raised the first keening when her son Bres was killed. She appears to have continued on in a new form in the person of Saint Brigid of Kildare, about whom we know quite a bit more; her story contains many interesting and possibly pre-Christian allusions.
