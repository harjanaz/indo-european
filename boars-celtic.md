# Celtic Boars
- with erect dorsal : war, the war trumpet carnyx had the mouth of a boar

o "Arduinna, a divine huntress of the Ardennes Forest, is portrayed on a bronze figurine astride a galloping boar, a hunting knife in her hand.
o "A pre-Roman carving from Euffigneix in eastern Gaul shows a god with the image of an aggressively bristled boar striding along his torso. The bellicosity suggested by the raised dorsal crest is emphasized on figurines of boars, such as that from Neuvy-en-Sullias (Loiret)."
o "Celtic helmets and shields carried boar-emblems as war-symbols, and the carnyx (war-trumpet) was fashioned with a snarling boar's head as its mouthpiece."
o "The focus of the Welsh tale of Culhwch and Olwen is Twrch Trwyth, a huge, destructive boar, and similar beasts are common in Irish myth: Orc Triath is the equivalent of Twrch Trwyth."
