## Abstract
The paper aims to describe the approach that Indo-Europeans had about cosmogony and the structure of the sky. It especially relies on the Greek, Latin and Hurrian conceptions. It is shown that the Indo- European cosmogony envisions the sky as three layers: the Upper-Sky, the Middle-Sky and the Lower- Sky. The gods and celestial bodies in each sky are different and have specific roles, names, colors and attributes. An appendix at the end lists the words and roots discussed in the paper.
