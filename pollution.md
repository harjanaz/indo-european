# Pollution

Even Pfister, for example, recognises "an undeniable growth of anxiety and dread in the evolution of Greek religion."[89] It is true that the notions of pollution, of purification, of divine phthonos , may well be part of the original Indo-European inheritance. But it was the Archaic Age that recast the tales of Oedipus and Orestes as horror-stories of bloodguilt; that made purification a main concern of its greatest religious institution, the Oracle of Delphi; that magnified the importance of phthonos until it became for Herodotus the underlying pattern of all history. This is the sort of fact that we have to explain. [[e-dodds1962]]
