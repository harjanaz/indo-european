## Description
Do we know the stories our Proto Indo European ancestors told? Well the answers is yes, we do know what the oldest stories in the world are. This video, the first of at least five, explores research carried out about five years ago called "Comparative phylogenetic analyses uncover the ancient roots of Indo-European folktales" by Jamshid J. Tehrani and Sara Graça da Silva. Using techniques looking at genetic fingerprinting to understand migration, layered on top of cultural similarity, and language similarity, a deeper understanding than has ever been realised before was discovered in these folktales. The language tree was the "Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of Indo European Languages” by the Bouckaetr et al. These fairy tales were passed down through generations of a tribe to ensure there survival. And here we uncover them and explain what the tales actually meant to our ancestors.
