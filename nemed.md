- According to one version of the story, a group descending from the Nemedians returned to Ireland as the Fir bolg...who could represent an actual pre-Celtic people in Ireland, are credited with the important division of the island into five provinces or coiceds (fifths) and with the establishment of a sacred kingship based on the relationship between the king's essential integrity and the land's fertility. The five provinces, which are basic to Irish myth and history, are Ulster in the north, Connaught in the west, Munster in the south, Leinster in the east, all held together by Mide (Meath), with Tara, the seat of the sacred king, at its center. The age of the Firbolg was a golden age of prosperity and peace.
