## Estonian
Parallel to churches and chapels there co-existed also a third group of holy sites - sacred natural sites of non-Christian character. These sites preserved their importance as offering and healing places until the nineteenth century….[they are] well remembered in oral tradition. 


Types
	1. High status & General
		○ Trees, groves, and stones
		○ Grant luck/success/welfare and protection against misfortune
		○ Offerings
			§ Making them was a duty, neglecting the site might bring about supernatural punishment. The sites "were subject to detailing mutual responsibilities"
		○ Subject to taboos, consequences of destroying or damaging them were supposed to be accidents, diseases and even death.
		○ Weakly represented in oral tradition
		○ Have a (secondary) function of healing
		
	2. "Lower" status & Healing
		○ Springs especially; but also trees, groves, and stones
		○ Healed: skin diseases, abscesses, scabs, and aching
		○ Method: 
			§ Transfer magic (the aching place was pressed against the healing object, or items which had been in contact with it were offered.)
			§ Spring water was drunk/used-for-washing
			§ Offerings: small gifts (this was a means for creating a connection between man and the supernatural)
		○ Visited in cases of emergency
		○ Numerous in western Estonia
		○ Strongly represented in oral tradition and outlasted the more General sites (due to Christianity)
		○ Less demanding than High-status/General sites, oral tradition expresses no need for permanent contact or communication, no indications that there were penalties for neglecting them. Not as subject to taboos.
