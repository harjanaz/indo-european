The word -mai-coh- means both 'wolf' and 'witch' among [Navajos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo "Navajo"), and -shunk manita tanka- a 'doglike powerful spirit' among [Sioux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux "Sioux"). The [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European-language "Proto-Indo-European language") root -\*ṷeid- ("knowledge, clairvoyance") designated the wolf in both Hittite (-ṷetna-) and Old Norse (-witnir-), and a "werewolf" in Slavic languages (Serbian -vjedo-gonja-, Slovenian -vedanec-, Ukrainian -viščun-).
