## Notes
### Proto-Austronesian
Proto-religious-vocabulary:
- `*kayam` ("**headhunting**")
- `*taban` ("Head/War-Trophy")
- `*qanicu` ("Ghost, spirit of the dead").

- "Headhunting was inextricably tied up with religious ideas, in particular notions of human and agricultural fertility resulting from the capture and ritual incorporation of souls or spiritual forces from outside the community."
- Tattooing may have been associated with headhunting
- No words for "war or battle", fighting seems to have been of a guerrilla kind, for revenge or booty.
Â 
### Proto-Malayo-Polynesian
- `*banua` ("Inhabited territory, as opposed to the wilderness. Akin to the Germanic in/out-garden notion.")
- `*hamuk` ("A violently antisocial psychological state which may or may not have had connotations with warfare". Gone into the English expression "to run amuck".)
- `*nawa` ("Life-force")
- `*sumanged` ("Spirit, as in 'the spirit of the rice'")
