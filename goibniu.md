# Goibniu
§ "[He] was one of a triad of craft gods: he was the smith, Luchta the wright, and Creighne the metalworker. Together they forged magical weapons (each made a different part) for Lugh and the Tuatha Dé in their great battle against the Fomorians..."
§ "[He] is the most developed character of the triad."
§ "His weapons always flew true and always killed."
§ "He had an additional role as host of the Otherworld Feast, where his special ale gave immortality."

Goibniu, Luchte, and Creidne [GOV-nyoo, LOOCH-tuh, CREDH-nuh; the ‘dh’ is the ‘th’ sound in ‘other’): These three brothers are Divine Craftsmen, a smith, carpenter and brazier, who were sometimes known as na tri dée dána, ‘the three gods of skill.’ They work with The Dagda and Ogma to defeat the Fomorians in Cath Maige Tuired by creating magical weapons. Goibniu was also said to preside over the Otherworld Feast of Immortality. [https://discoverdruidry.wordpress.com/2018/05/28/calling-to-the-hollow-hills-irish-gods-names-and-attributes/]
