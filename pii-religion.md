They, compared to the other IE branches, best preserved PIE pastoralism. [(b-lincoln1981p6n27)](b-lincoln1981)
#### Religion
Eschatology [[m-ara2006]]
Concering their religion, there are 4 theories:
1. That the PII gods were personified abstractions of a moral nature [(p-thieme1957)]((p-thieme1957).md)
2. That a cosmic dualism is expressed in the pantheon [(f-kuiper)]((f-kuiper).md)
3. That the pantheon was a projection of the household [(h-bailey1975)]((h-bailey1975).md)
4. That the pantheon was a projection of a tripartite class system [(g-dumezil1945)]((g-dumezil1945).md)

[(b-lincoln1981p11-12n56)](b-lincoln1981) critiqued these 4, saying they focus too much on gods and not enough on myth, ritual, etc.
