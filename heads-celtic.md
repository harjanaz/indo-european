# Celtic Heads
[[d-clarke1998]]

Head-hunting was apart of the cultic traditions of certain Celts

They had magical properties, especially those of supernatural heroes.


[Livy, Strabo, Diodorus]: decapitation of war victims, heads kept as trophies or offered in shrines

[Sanctuaries and Oppida in the Celto-Ligurian area of southern Gaul, around Marseille. The Cliff-top shrine of Roquepertuse, 6-2nd century BC]
	Portico adorned with niches containing the nailed-in skulls of young men who had died in battle
	
[Bredon Hill hillfort (Worcestershire), Britain]
	Heads mounted on poles guarded the entrances as symbolic protection
	
	
[R-C Britain, 3rd-4th centuries AD]
	People decapitated after death before being interred in their tombs 
	
[Kimmeridge, Dorset, Britain]
	The bodies of old women were beheaded and the lower jaws removed. It is tempting to see these ladies as witches, prevented from talking and casting spells beyond the grave. 
	
	
[Romano-Celtic Iconography]
	Emphasis on the human head
	
[Welsh and Irish Myth]
	CÃº Chulainn collected the heads of his enemies and placed them on stones.
	It was prophesied that the Ulstermen, smitten by Macha's curse of weakness, would regain their strength if they drank the milk from the huge severed head of Conall Cernach. In this tale the dead attains the properties of a cauldron of regeneration. Readers will recall the similar story of Bendigeidfran in the Mabinogi, whose severed head can speak and encourage his companions, bringing them good fortune on their long journey from Harlech to London.
