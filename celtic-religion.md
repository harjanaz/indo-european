### Jupiter Columns

- Monster of darkness = giant with serpents for legs

### Pits/Shafts

Function: A means of (a) communicating with and (b) propitiating, the chthonic via sacrifices and votive gifts.

?I wonder if copper was thrown in wells to purify them?

[Grain Storage Pits @ Hampshire hillfort of Danebury]

- Bodies of animals and humans were interred in these pits and then filled.

- Interpretation: Thank-offerings to the Underworld gods whose space had been violated by the digging of the pits and who needed both to be placated and thanked for keeping the stored corn fresh.

[Gournay sanctuary]

- Huge central pit filled with the rotting bodies of sacrificed cattle 

- Interpretation: Feeds the chthonic gods

### Traditions

- Hung animal heads on trees

### Numinosity of Natural Landscape

- Gave rise to open air worship (ex. [Groves](groves.md))
- The landscape was numinous
- Settlements: "in southern Gaul, Glanius was the spirit of Glanum and Nemausus was the name both of Nimes and of the god who presided over the sacred spring."
- Mountains: "Vosegus was the god of the Vosges in eastern Gaul; and Ladicus, the...spirit of Mount Ladicus in north-west Spain"
- Trees: "their roots and branches evoked an image of a link between sky and Underworld; their longevity represented continuity and wisdom; the seasonal behavior of deciduous trees gave rise to cyclical symbolism, an allegory of life, death and rebirth. Trees were associated with cults of fertility and nature, partly because of this regenerative imagery: the mother-goddesses are frequently associated with trees; Rhenish altars to the mother-goddesses from Bonn bear tree-symbols; the sanctuary of the mothers at Pesch (Germany) had a sacred tree as its cult-focus. Gaulish tribal names display tree-veneration: the Eburones were the 'Yew Tribe', the Lemovices the 'People of the Elm'. In Ireland a sacred tree was called a *bile*; the older the tree, the greater its sanctity. All trees in Irish myth were sacred but the oak, yew, ash and hazel were particularly holy. In the Dinnshenchas allusion is made to trees as sources of sacred wisdom. Irish holy trees were associated with sacred kingship: the inauguration of a ruler always took place in the presence of a sacred tree, a symbol of sovereignty, tradition and wisdom. A group of trees (a grove) was equally sacred, called *fidnemed* in Ireland and *nemeton* by the Gauls and Britons.
