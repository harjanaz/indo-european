## Norse
The Dead Without Status by Juha Pentik√§inen in Nordic Folklore: Recent Studies:
"In Nordic tradition, naming is an older rite than Christian baptism. In the Icelandic sagas a father demonstrates his approval by receiving the child that was brought to him, pouring water on it, and giving it a name (Reichborn-Kjen-nerud, 1933, 83. The question of keeping or abandoning the child was settled at the moment of name-giving. A child that for one reason or another was not accepted and not given a name, was exposed (Gunnlaugs saga, 1938, 55-56; Hardar saga, 1945, 11-14)...Child abandonment seems to have been an approved custom in the Nordic countries before the advent of Christianity. The tradition follows the old Roman and Germanic practice according to which the head of the family, usually the father, had the right to decide whether a child born into the family was to be provided for or exposed."
