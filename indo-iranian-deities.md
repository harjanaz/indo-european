They had an otiose Sky Father (`*Dyaus`). He had a large number of associates (Skt. Ādityās; Av. Aməša Spəntas). These associates were led by two sovereigns: a legal one (`*Mitra`) and a magical one (`*Varuna`). These two sovereigns both resided in the heavens, play a role in creation, and rule over the world dispensing favors and punishments to man.

They also had the [Wise Lord](wise-lord.md) and a demiurge, [The Shaper](the-shaper.md).
