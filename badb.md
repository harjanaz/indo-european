# Badb
- Irish Crow Goddess
§ "a goddess of battle and its destructive qualities....violence, fury and war."
§ "one of her names is Badbh Catha ('Battle Crow')"
§ "She is both a single and triple goddess."
§ "Her power on the battlefield is psychological: her presence confounds and terrifies soldiers and she wrecks havoc..."
§ "a prophetess of doom and death"
§ "She helps Cú Chulainn, but alights in bird-form on his shoulder when he dies. She appears as "Washer at the Ford", rinsing the arms of a warrior who will shortly die in battle. In the story of Da Derga's Hostel, she appears to the doomed king Conaire as three black, crow-like hags: the imagery of bird and woman is merged."
