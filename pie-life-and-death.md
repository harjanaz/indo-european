[[pie-beings]]

---

> The gods are eternal 
> - Yet, they eat special life-providing foods
> 
> Being endowed with [[life]] necessitates [[pie-death]] for [[pie-mortals-humans-people]] (i.e. we have [[mortality]], or a finite amount of [[ie-time]]). 
> - Yet, we live out an [[afterlife]] in the [[otherworld]] as [[pie-ancestors]] and are venerated in a [[pie-cult-of-ancestors]] by the living.
> - Yet, we can visit the [[otherworld]] while alive via special means.
> - Yet, through [[kleos-fame-memory]] we attain immortality.
