# Svarog

#### Hammer and Vajra's View
> Svarog (Old Church Slavonic: Сваро́гъ, Russian: Сварог, Polish: Swaróg).
While he is often considered to be associated with Hephaestus via some studies and possible Euhemerism. Others suggest the worship of the god Rod is actually attributable to Svarog. 
In certain Slavic reconstruction groups it he is considered to be the greatest or father of the Gods and possibly the representation of a monist One. 
6th Century Greekologist John Malalas wrote. 
"(Then) began his reign Feosta (Hephaestus), whom the Egyptians called Svarog… during his rule, from the heavens fell the smith’s prongs and weapons were forged for the first time; before that, (people) fought with clubs and stones. Feosta also commanded the women that they should have only a single husband… and that is why Egyptians called him Svarog… After him ruled his son, his name was the Sun, and they called him Dažbog… Sun tzar, son of Svarog, this is Dažbog."
I personally believe the Egyptian association is completely wrong and is often the mistake people of a Greek oriented academia would make. 
In a more Indo-European basis his name is closer to that of Sanskrit.
 sva-rāj : self-resplendent, self-luminous, shining of one's self (said of the Ashvins, Indra, Mitra, and Varuna); the supreme Being (Brahman)
svā-rāj: the ruler of heaven, i. e. Indra
And  Swarga or Svarga Loka the realm of the Heavens where the Devas reside which is governed by Indra.
This realm is said to be metaphyiscally on and around Mt. Meru which would make Svarog more akin to Zeus / Indra. 
In the paradigm of Slavic traditions it seems that Svarog more akin to Saturn with Perun taking the position of Indra / Zeus to some extent.  This makes sense in the Rod context as well with Crodo (Rod) being worshiped as Saturn (Saturday) in the Slavo-Saxon.  Svarog is father of the Day (Dažbog) who may be connected to Dyḗus the Sky father we receive the word Day from. This would makes sense as Zeus / Jupiter is derived from the same word and Saturn (Crodo / Cronus/  Svarog ? ) is his father.  
UPG note: I believe them to be an aspect of or evolutionary succession of the same deity.
