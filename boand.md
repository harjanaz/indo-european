# Boand
Boand: [BOE-and; later spelled Boann and pronounced BO-uhn]. Her name means “White / Blessed Cow,’ coming from the root word find (later spelled finn), which means ‘white, bright or blessed.’ She has an affair with the Dagda, resulting in the birth of Oengus mac Óg. There is an important place-name story in which she approaches the Well of Segais, which could only be approached by Nechtan and his three cup-bearers. She walks around it in a non-sunwise direction and as a result the river rises up and disfigures and drowns her; she then becomes the spirit of the River Boyne. Boand also appears in the Accalam, in some very interesting stories. [https://discoverdruidry.wordpress.com/2018/05/28/calling-to-the-hollow-hills-irish-gods-names-and-attributes/v]
