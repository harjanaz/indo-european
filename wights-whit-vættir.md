## Norse Beings (vættr/vættir)
The term can be used to refer to the full Norse cosmos of supernatural beings, including the Álfar (elves), Dvergar (dwarves), Jötnar (giants), and gods (the Æsir and Vanir). Vættir can also refer more specifically to to Landvættir (nature spirits), Sjóvættir (sea spirits), vatnavættir (guardians of the specific waters), or Húsvættir (house spirits.)
