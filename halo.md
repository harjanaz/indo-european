- A miraculous radiance, sent by the divine, which granted succes...conceived in the form of a light-bird descending to, or going away from, the head of a warrior or prince [idk about a mature king] when they were engaged in battle or for the purpose of presaging a glorious destiny for them both [hence princes not kings?]. In both cases it is also a sign of beneolence and benin predestination.

- The culture that retained the original charcteristics the most was the Irish. In Greece and Rome only faint traces survived, and in Iran it became a previlige reserved for the adepts of the 'true' religon (Zoroastrianism).

- (e-campanile 1988): Neither Livy nor Vergil were any more aware of the real and original meaning of this miracuous light and consequently they interpreted it as merely a generic lucky omen. (Fire = Lamp of fortune...but no mention of kingly destiny)

- Achilles when eneter battle (Iliad 18.206, 225)
  
  > ***Iliad*** 18.206
  > 
  > Achilles, whom the gods loved, rose. Around his mighty shoulders Athena threw her tassled aegis, and the shining goddess Haoled his head with a gold cloud that shot flames from its incandescent glow. [...] So too the radiance that flared from Achilles' head and up to the sky. [...] And the combed horses shied from their chariots, eyes wide with fear, and their drivers went numb when they saw the fire above Achilles' head burned into the sky by the Grey-Eyed One. (trans.
