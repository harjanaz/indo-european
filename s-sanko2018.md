## Abstract
> As the images of Saint George and Saint Nicholas in Belarusian folklore converged, forming a non-canonical pairing, they assimilated a number of features indicative of an earlier tradition of divine twins’ veneration. Specifically, the paper focuses on the following features: 1) the possible traces of the devatādvandva grammatical form and the dual number; 2) a special attitude towards horses; 3) Saints George and Nicholas accompanying (in the capacity of charioteers) a female deity or a mythological creature (Blessed Mother, Au-rora); 4) Saints George and Nicholas accompanying a character who inherits the Thunderer’s features (Saint Elijah, Saint Michael the Archangel); 5) systematic differences within a pair when one of the members is portrayed as a young man (Saint George) and the other one as an old man (Saint Nicholas); 6) the duplication of a single saint’s image; 7) narratives of twin healers, one of whom functions as a surgeon and the other one as a thaumaturge.
