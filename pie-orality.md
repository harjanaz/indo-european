# PIE *wékwos*
"word, speech"

IE's see words as magical and powerful, sacred speech is the blueprint of the creation of the worlds. 

## Iranian **wáj/báj**
Old Iranian **wăk**
Avestan **vač** "voce, word, language, speech"
- **wáj/báj** "a sacre speech formula of benediction which serves to invoke Gods/Immortals favor upon life activities". It consecrates the early acts with sacred spiritual power, and must be recited gracefully. once the initial portion of the waj preceding the action has been recited, quiet has to be maintained till the waj is concluded by the recitation of the concluding portion. For example after the initial waj for breaking bread (eating) or waj for bathing is recited no other words may be pronounced, complete silence must be maintained until the concluding waj formulae is spoken after the meal/bath. IF any communication has to be done (in emergencies), you have to do with siently or with your hands. Priests take waj between themselves to make the rite more effective and maintain the magic. The term also refers to the invocation prayers at the beginning and end of long avestan prayers. the Wāj yašt srösh is a prayer dedicated to sraôša, the Lord of Sacred Spech and inspiration.
- In the Gathas the ahuras forge/fashion the poetic thought (mánthra).
## Old Norse vátta "voice, word"

In reference to the *Tain* [(j-nagy1997)]((j-nagy1997).md)p19 says *"The myth of recovering the totality (or the proper sequence of episodes) of a tale of epic proportions is also found in classical Greek literature (as in the legend of the Peisistratean recension of Homer), as well as in Persian and Indian traditions concerning the origins of "canonical" texts of epic poems."*
