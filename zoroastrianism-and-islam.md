Correction: https://sunnah.com/muslim:2368 “I affirm my faith in Allah It is my ownself that deceived me.”


Jesus does not appear in an expplictly eschatological role until the 9th and 10th century A.D. hadiths.  We need to look further in history for that. So, how did Muslims understand this verse, and more broadly, how did they come to understand Jesus’ relationship to the end days? 

Why was Jesus incporated into Islam in the first place?
Shared Abrahamic religious and scriptoral tradition
geographic proximity
probably to attract and retain followers (similar to Jesus’ incorporation into Manichaeism)
How was this done?
Why the ESCHATOLOGICAL incorporation tho?

Around 846 A.D. Muhammad al-Bukhari (810-870) in his Sahih al-Bukhari states:
https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2476
https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3449

In 923 AD Al-Tabari stated in his tafsīr that the Prophet was reported to have said “One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of Jesus the son of Mary before the Day of Resurrection”. Al-Qurtubi (1272 AD) and Ibn Kathir (1373 AD) said the same.

Unfortunatly we of course don’t have a complete record because of lost hadiths and the selectivity of of the haith compilers themselves. For example “Out of 300,000 hadith which he evaluated, approximately 12,000 were extracted for inclusion into his collection based on stringent acceptance criteria.” Sahih Muslim.

(822–875).

  “One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of Jesus the son of Mary before the Day of Resurrection”

The Prophet is reported to have said, “One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of Jesus the son of Mary before the Day of Resurrection” (IK, Q,Ṭ), at which point it is said that he will fight the Antichrist (al-Dajjāl), eventually die, and be resurrected like other mortals. (Nasr et al)

This verse was traditionally interpreted as meaning Jesus will return during the end days, although the Qurʼān does not spell that out. 

According to Islamic tradition which describes this graphically, Jesus will return to aid al-Mahdi ("the rightly guided one”)in his war against al-Masih ad-Dajjal (false messiah") and his followers. Jesus, considered as a Muslim, will abide by the Islamic teachings. Eventually, Jesus will slay al-Masih ad-Dajjal, and then everyone who is one of the People of the Book (ahl al-kitāb, referring to Jews and Christians) will believe in him.
