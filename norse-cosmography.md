Verticle *vs* Horizontal models (Meletinskij 1973a, 1973b)

### Horizontal

- ***Miðgarðr*** & ***Útgarðr***. 
- These parallel the human farm division between the ***innangarðs*** & ***útangarðs***. 
- The cosmogony consisted of the division into these two parts by the ***æsir*** and the building of ***Ásgarðr*** somewhere inside *Miðgarðr*. [(g-turville1964p276)]((g-turville1964).md). There was no opposition between heaven and earth in this model, and topographically *Ásgarðr* was inseperable from *Miðgarðr* [(a-gurevich1969p43)]((a-gurevich1969).md) & [(e-meletinskij1973ap47)]((e-meletinskij1973a).md)
