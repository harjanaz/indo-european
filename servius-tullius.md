# Servius Tullius

> ***Livy*** (1.39)
> 
> *At that time there happened in the house of the king a portent which was remarkably alke in its manifestation and in its outcome. The story is that **while a child named Servius Tullius lay sleeping, his head burst into flames in the sight of many**. The general outcry which was so great a miracle called forth brought the king and queen to the place. One of the servants fetched water to quench the fire, but was checked by the queen, who stilled the uproar and commanded that the boy should not be disturbed until he awoke of himself. Soon afterwards sleep left him, and with it disappeared the flames. Then, taking her husband aside, Tanaquil said: 'Do you see this child whom we are bringing up in so humble a fashion? Be assured **he will one day be a lamp to our dubioud fortunes**'.*  (trans. Foster)
