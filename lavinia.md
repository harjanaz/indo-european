# Lavinia

> ***Aeneid*** (7.71)
> 
> Moreover, while with hallowed torch he kindles the altars, and at her father's side stands the maiden Lavinia, she was seen - O horror! - to catch fire in her long tresses and burn with crackling flame in all her headgear. 

"This passage confirms that in late Roman culture the originary meaning of the *lúan láith* was effaced to the extent that a poet coud even imagine it chining on a woman's head." (e-campanile 1988)
