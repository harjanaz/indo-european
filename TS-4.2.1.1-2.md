> *The gods, men, and the Pitrs were on one side, the Asuras, Raksases, and Piçacas on the other. Of the gods the little blood they drew the Raksases smothered by the nights and dawn dawned on them smothered and dead. The gods understood, ‘Him who of us dies, it is the Raksases who kill. They invited the Raksases, they said, ‘Let us choose a boon; what we win from the Asuras, let that be shared between us. Then indeed did the gods conquer the Asuras, and having conquered the Asuras, they drove away the Raksases. The Raksases (saying), ‘Ye have done falsely’, surrounded the gods on all sides. The gods found a protector in Agni … That the gods prospered, the Raksases were defeated.*
