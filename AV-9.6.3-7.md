> Verily when a host looks at his guests he looks at the place of sacrifice to the Gods. When he salutes them reverently he undergoes preparation for a religious ceremony: when he calls for water, he solemnly brings sacrificial water. The water that is solemnly brought at a sacrifice is this same water. The libation which they bring; the sacrificial victim dedicated to Agni and Soma which is tied to the post, that, verily, is this man. When they arrange dwelling-rooms they arrange the sacred chamber and the shed for housing the Soma cars.
