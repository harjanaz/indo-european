### PIE
- Mixed with [Barley](barley.md) to make [Xádōr](xador.md)


### India

- In India, a mixture of [salt](salt.md) and barley is cast on ploughed fields to encourage the growth of the crops [(j-gonda1980p429)]((j-gonda1980).md). This is an odd thing to do, since salt prevents growth (the Romans' ploughing the destroyed Carthage with salt to make sure that noting would ever grow there again is famous). We are clearly dealing with a religious significance of a mixture of barley and salt, used for blessing.
