# Cathbad
§ Ulster's royal Druid
§ "[He] repeatedly foretells the future of Ulster...instruct[s] young heroes in the craft of divination, [and plots]...which days were lucky or unlucky for specific events or activities."
§ "[He] is related to Cú Chulainn as either foster-father, grandfather or natural father..."
§ "His honor-code, unlike that of the archetypal hero, is flawed and his treachery to Naoise and cruelty to Deirdre bring about the defection of three prominent Ulster warriors."
