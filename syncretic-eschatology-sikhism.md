## On the Hindu Hill Tribes
  

Many but it wasn't religious war. It's just that the kings they fought were of Hindu religion or whatever sect they followed that time.

Rajputs, Hill Rajas, Brahmins who were all part of or allied with Mughal Empire during the battle is who Sikh Gurus, Guru Hargobind and later Guru Gobind Singh fought against.

Keep in mind, it was Brahmin Suchanand who forced to have Guru Gobind's two young children to be executed. It was Brahmin Gangu who betrayed Guru Gobind Singh by informing Mughals about the where abouts of his mother and two young children.

  

**The wars with the Hill Rajas were not religious conflicts. They were political wars. Labelling them with tags of religions is misplaced and mischievous. Infact, they fought largely FOR Hindus. The war with Hill Rajputs were power conflict. Ninth and Tenth Guru started collecting taxes from around Anandpur Sahib and Sikh militia started imposing law and order around the area. The Nawab of Sarhind and Hill Rajputs thought Guru Gobind Singh was setting up a new kingdom that would eventually threaten their states. So they ganged up on Sikhs in panic. It was a secular conflict with no religious intent. Hindu Rajputs of the plains had fully backed Sikhs .**

  

  

It were the Brahmin priests in Jehangir's darbar, one of the responsible group in strategizing the execution of Guru Arjan.

Below were allies of Aurangzeb during battles against Guru Gobind Singh:

-   Jaspat Rai and Lakhpat Rai, two hindu brothers general in Mughal Army responsible in the war and massacre of both Hindu and Sikhs.
-   Rajputs Ajot Singh of Jodhpur and Man Singh of Amber are also examples.
-   Raja Ajmer Chand
-   Raja Dalip Singh of Guler State
-   Rajas of the Sivalik Hills
-   Kesari Chand
-   Ghumand Chand

Massa Ranghar though born to both Muslim and Hindu is an example.

Mughals mostly had allies and they were all non muslims and that is who the Sikh Gurus fought against to protect the innocents no matter what religion anyone belonged to.
