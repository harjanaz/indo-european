## Narratives
1. [[cosmic-primordial]]
2. [[first-sacrifice]]
3. [[first-warrior-trito]]


Two kinds, which sometimes overlap: 
1. Creation of the Cosmos "Cosmography"
2. A subtype: the Creation of Humans


Things which are [[cosmic-primordial]]

Brothers [[twin-yemo]] & [[manu-first-man]]
The former sacrifices the latter (along with the cow? see below)

## From Primordial Being (Twin, [Cow](bovines.md), etc)
- Dual-sexed or Twin being is sacrificed
- Nor. Ymir
- Iranian Gayomart (*gayamaretan*)
- Skt. Prajapati, Manu
- 
- Grk. Phanes
- Lat. Romulus & Remus
### Milk
- The creation was associated with milk (especially when cattle & twins are involved).
- Latin via lactea**. The twins Romulus and Remus are claimed to have been raised and nourished by a She-Wolf before they founded the city of Rome after Romulus killed Remus. 
- Greek γαλαξίας/γαλαξίας κύκλος ( galaxías kýklos ). In Greek myth, it was said that Hera (the "Cow-Faced/Eyed") was tricked into nursing Heracles (Hercules) as she slept and either by him biting her, or just waking up naturally she realized that he was suckling and threw the Half mortal that she despised down to the Earth, a spray of milk from him being flung created the Milky Way.
- The Milky Way Galaxy contains both our physical and metaphysical/spiritual existence. 
- The Norse primordial Audhumla ("hornless cow") provided milk to [[ymir]] ("Twin, hermaphrodite"). Additionally, 4 rivers of milk flowed from her dwelling (ginnungagap). This is interesting as it gives the further nod to the divine twins’ concept in which one brother kills another in sacrifice to create the world in Indo-European myth (Rudolf Simek, Dictionary of Northern Mythology 1993). Ymir gives birth to the race of Giants via his own body. Keep in mind Giant themselves aren’t exactly how modern English interprets them and can be seen as Great ones or a type of God. One of these giants interbreeds with the God Buri, which Audhumla licks free from the Ice. Buri begets the trinity of Odin, Villi, and Ve who slay Ymir molding Midgard from his body. It’s my theory that this keeps in line with the theme of the twin as these brothers would have been related to Ymir as they were born from his line as well. See Grímnismál
- Interestingly enough, while Ymir’s blood was shed, there was a great flood, and the ocean was created. Furthermore, in the translation of Jeremiah 51:42 in Icelandic, the word Ymjandi is used in conjunction with the flood. Havið fløddi Bábel undir, huldi hana í sínum ymjandi bylgjum. – Jeremia 51:42 FB The sea will rise over Babylon; its roaring waves will cover her. – Jeremiah 51:42 NIV



## From [*hieros gamos*](hieros-gamos.md)


## [World Tree](axis-mundi.md) as Progenitor of Humans
- Norse [*Ask* & *Embla*](ask&embla.md)
- Mashya & Mashyana from a giant tree which sprouted from the seed of the slain Gayomart (mentioned above).


## Trinities
- Nor. **Odin**, **Vili**, & **Ve** (sacrifice Ymir)
- Nor. ***Hárr*** ("High"), ***Jafnhárr*** ("Just as High"), & ***Þriði*** ("Third"). These are quite likely the different aspects of Odin himself. As ***Woðanaz*** , ***Weljon*** , and ***Wixan*** could be the proto-Germanic connection to various names of Odin. This plays into the Trinity concept of three Gods but one. 
- ***Odin***, ***Hœnir***, & ***Lóðurr***. Provided soul, sense, and hue
- Skt. ***Ādityas***, ***Vasus***, & ***Rudras*** [[RV-30.02]]
- Skt. ***trimūrti*** or ***trayastri ṃ śat*** (Brahma, Vishun, & Shiva)
