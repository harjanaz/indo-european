Hymn to the Horse
- is the "soul..bird" in v6 ("your soul, the bird, flying below the sky") the horse's sun-form (like Doniger thinks) or is it his soul as a bird?
- v10 "the racecourse of the sky" (afterlife)
- v12 "The goat, his kin" (goats are kept with horses to calm them down; or a scapegoat)
- v13 "May he go t othe gods today and...ask for the things that teh worshipper wishes for" (like a Cathoic Saint)
