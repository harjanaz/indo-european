# Tyr

## Norse Tyr
"Fenris...bit Tyr's hand off. In folklore, the wrist is called the 'wolf-joint' because of this." [1]

The best-known story of Týr, the binding of Fenris wolf, tells how he lost his hand through swearing a false oath (Snorri, “Gylfaginning,” 34). The gods knew that the wolf needed to be bound because otherwise he would destroy the world. 
He nevertheless lost his hand. Even gods must suffer from false oaths, no matter how nobly made.
