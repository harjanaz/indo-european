Śūraṅgama (Heart) Mantra

Sitātapatroṣṇīṣa Dhāraṇī
The Śūraṅgama Lituny (English Translation)

​

At that time the World-honoured One, from the fleshy crown of His head, sent out a sparkling flood of light rays and, amidst these rays, burst forth a thousand-petaled jewelled lotus.

​

A transformed Tathāgata sat within this jewelled flower the crown of His head emitting hundreds of glistening light rays in all directions;

​

Everywhere each light revealed all things as numerous as the myriad grains of sand in the Ganges.

​

The Vajrapanis, Jewel in hand, lighted up the mountains, appearing everywhere within the vault of

space; the great assembly beheld this with awe.

Unable to hold on to their fears and desires, they sought the Buddha’s pity and aid and whole-

heartedly hearkened unto the radiant Tathāgata atop the now-concealed crown of the Buddha’s head as he chanted this sacred Invocation.

​

The Invocation of All the Transformations of the Invincible One

​









Homage to the Triple Treasure!

​








Homage to the wise and holy ones who live amidst the devas!
Homage to those who preserve these words of pure and bright Dharma!
Homage to the wise and holy ones who preserve this pure Dharma and to those who likewise

facilitate its recitation!

​




Homage to the Adored One!
Homage to Mahākāla, Him of the Dark Realms, who put to flight the triply-fortified cities of the haughty asuras, the Confident One, along with His host of Divine Mothers who dwell within the burning-grounds of the dead!

Homage to the Adored One!

​

We bow in homage to all of you for you are the white canopy of light that covers the crown of the exalted Tathāgata’s head, all the Transformations of the Invincible One adored by all celestial beings, honored by all celestial beings and guarded over by every celestial being!

We pray that You make all devilish entanglements and fascinations subside, Make known what needs to be known,
Tame those who would prolong pain,
Protect us from evil,

Keep us safe from an untimely death,
Liberate us from all our fetters,
Protect us from all that is difficult to tame and from nightmarish dreams,
Free us from the four and eighty thousand enticements,
Purify the eight and twenty mansions wherein the Moon of our Original Nature abides,
Rid us of the eight great distractions of gain and loss, fame and disgrace, praise and ridicule,

elation and sorrow,
Protect us from all enemies,
Make all mysteries disappear and evil visions dissolve
And make us strangers to poison, sword, fire and flood.
We call upon Thee, the Great Fierce One from the Family of the Invincible, the Great Adítya

whose mighty brilliance blazes forth like the sun, destroying all darkness,
And upon Thee, the Great DazzlingWhite One of the blazing light, the mighty white-robed One who abides within the white lotus. the Noble Liberator born from the tear-filled eve of

Compassion,
And upon Thee, Bhríkuti, the Wrathful Frowning One who sprang from the scowling brow of

Compassion,
And upon Thee, the victorious Vajrámriti, the Indestructible One crystal clear as the Sweet Dew, And upon Thee, the flower-wreathed Vajra-tongued One famed for Thy teaching of the ways to sit

in meditation.

And upon Thee, the One with the Invincible Vajra-sceptre, honored by celestial beings as the One who is thoroughly free from defiling passions,

And upon Thee, Avalokiteśvara, the Great White One whose form is as a flower,
And upon Thee with the Vajra-chains which bind all evil, second only to the Noble

Avalokiteśvara in might, along with Thy Vajra-handmaidens, the upholders of the Families, And upon Thee, the Golden-garlanded One whose great knowledge is as a diamond which Thou holdest in Thy hand, the Jewel in the Red Safflower, Vairochana, from whose actions the head

crown arises,
And upon Thee, Lochána, with Thy garlands in full bloom, Divine Mother Who is Wisdom, Thee

whose Vajra is lustrous as gold, who, like the Vajra-beaked Ganúda, swallows the serpent of hatred, the Dazzling White One whose eyes are like lotus blossoms, radiant as the moon at its fullest.

As thus we speak, may all of you through your multitudinous mudra signs protect us from all things!

​

Om to the crown of the Tathāgata which the whole assembly of Holy Ones praise!

Hūm trūm, smash all fetters!
Hūm trūm, restrain all evil!
Hūm trūm. shine forth!

Hūm trūm, stir up the lethargic mind!
