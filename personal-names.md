- Latin Mithridates is the Latin rendering of the Old Iranian theophoric name *Miθra-dāta ("given by Miθra"), which became Mihrdāt in Parthian. The name is a determinative compound, consisting of the theonym *Miθra and the past participle *dāta - "given" (from the verbal root *dā - "to give, to grant"). The name *Miθra-dāta* is preserved in Iranian languages as: MP. Mihrdād, NP. Mehrdād. The name was also borrowed into Non-Iranian languages like: Old Greek. Mithradates/Mithridates, Latin. Mithridates/Meherdates, Babylonian. Mi-it-ra-da-a-tú/Mi-it-ra-da-ta(-a), Aramaic. mtrdt, Hebrew. mtrdt, Demotic. mtrtt, Old Armenian. Mihrdat. Interestingly "Mithraphoric names" (theophoric names containing the theonym Mithra) were very popular in the Parthian empire. Beside Mihrdāt we have also Mihrbarzan ("exalting Mihr"), Mihrbōg ("having joy through Mihr"), Mihrbuxt ("redeemed by Mihr"), Mihrbōžan ("who invigorates Mihr"), Mihrxšahr („having rule/dominion through Mihr“), Mihrxwāšt („desired/requested by Mihr“), Mihrak (< Old Iranian. *Miθra-ka), Mihrān (< Old Iranian. *Miθr-āna), Mihrpān („having the protection of Mihr“), Mihrfradāt („established/created by Mihr“), Mihrfarn ("having the Glory of Mihr, having the Glory through Mihr"), Mihrfriy ("dedicated to Mihr"), Mihrbān („with the sheen of Mihr“), Mihrēn (< Old Iranian.* Miθtr-aina), Frādamihr („furthering Mithra“), Rēw-Mihr („being rich by Mithra“?). The theonym Mihr was also used for humans, very probably as a shortened form for full "Mithraphoric names".
