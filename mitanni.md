- The oldest text showing tripartation is the 14th century BC letter between the Mitannian king, Matiwaza, and his Hittite conquerers. It is preserved at the archives in Boghazk√∂y. The ruling class is referred to as *marya* or *maru* (= Indian [Indra](indra) and his [Maruts](maruts.md)). This would seem to indicate at least the IE warrior class, but that the other two strata were present is quite possible given the series of gods listed in the treaty. (g-dumezil 1945p8-11)
