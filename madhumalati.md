## Notes

Usually in sanskrit literature the Kali Yuga is associated with hordes of barabarians ("Vedas don’t exist, there is no rule of law, Dharma disappeared, virtue vanished, Merit has fled and Nobility faded. What is left is the anarchy of Kali Yuga.") IS THIS TALKING ABOUT ISLAM? I THINK SO? WHAT KINGDOM?EMPIRE?
