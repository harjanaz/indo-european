## Etymology
There were a couple terms for "the divine" in PIE.  
- The first `*dei̯u̯ós` was derived from the [[pie-sky-father]]'s name and literally means a "heavenly one". 
- Another  was 	`*dʰeh₁s-` (as in Grk *theós* "god", Arm *dik'* "gods", Lat. *fēriae* "holi-days"). It was probably related to `*dheh1-` ("put, place").

## Gods by Category
There were many pie gods. Here are some ways we can group them:
- **By Concept**: there were two main categories, [Nature Gods](pie-nature-gods.md) and [Social Gods](pie-social-gods.md). Some gods fit in both, some neither. But most do, and most of the nature gods have to do with the sky.
- **By Social Organization**: Some of them were apart of a [[divine-family]]
- **By Gender**: [Male](pie-gods-male.md) vs [Female](pie-goddesses.md)
- **By Historical Branch** [->](pie-gods-by-branch.md)
- [Other ways of organizing them, and misc notes](pie-gods-misc-notes.md)
