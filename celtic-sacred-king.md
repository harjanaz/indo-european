# Celtic Sacred King

- Underpins much of Insular myth

- The ruler was linked to the fortunes and prosperity of the land itself

- ***The royal court of Tara***
  
  - The traditional sacred site of royal inauguration
  
  - Here the ritual marriage was enacted between the king and the land, personified as the goddess of sovereignty (Ériu, Medb)
  
  - Medb of Connacht cohabitated with nine kings, and no man could rule in Tara unless he first mated with her.
  
  - A symbol of this union of divinity with mortal is the transformation of the goddess, often from an old hag to a young girl of great beauty."

- The king-elect had to undergo various tests to prove the validity of his claim: the royal mantle had to fit him; the royal chariot must accept him; the Stone of Fál at Tara must shriek when touched by him. The rightful king must  be seen in a dream by the participant at the *tarbhfhess* or bull-sleep. Once elected, the king was hedged about with *geissi*, bonds or sacred rules of conduct, the betrayal of which would cause his downfall.  Like Cú Chulainn.
