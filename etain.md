# Étaín
§ "The character of Étain is...superhuman...She is reborn but retains her old identity 1000 years later; she is intimately linked with two deities, Oenghus and Midhir; and, most importantly, by her marriage to the Irish king, she fulfils the function of the goddess of sovereignty, validating his rule by their union."
