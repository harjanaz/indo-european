Cwn Annwn, the death hounds of the Welsh Annwn

o "healing, hunting and death, derived from observation of the self-healing power of a dog's lick, its scavenging habits and its role in hunting."
o "Arawn, lord of Annwn, possessed supernatural hounds, described in the Mabinogi as white with read ears. The Taliesin poem Cwn Annwn (the Hounds of Annwn) refers to speckled, greyish-red dogs which are omens of death. The ulster hero Cu Chulainn has a close link with dogs. Named the 'Hound of Culann', he takes the place of the smith's great hound, whom he has killed; he also has a geis or bond which forbids him to eat dog-flesh. Mac Da Tho, who presides over an Irish Otherworld feast, has an enormous and supernatural hound, whom he offers both to the men of Ulster and of Connacht, thus promoting their mutual hatred."
o "In…Gaul and Britain there is evidence of dog-ritual and sacrifice. At Danebury in Hampshire dogs (often in association with horses) were killed and interred is disused grain-storage pits during the Iron Age; at the pre-Roman shrine of Gournay (Oise), dogs were consumed in ritual meals."
o "Hunter-gods are depicted accompanied by large hounds. Apollo Cunomaglus ('Hound Lord') was invoked at the sanctuary of Nettleton in Wiltshire. The great Romano-Celtic shrine at Lydney, Gloucestershire, was presided over by Nodens, a god who received offerings of dog-images. The marine goddess Nehalennia presided over two temples on the North Sea coast of the Netherlands, at Colijnsplaat and Domburg…More than a hundred images of the goddess have survived, nearly all of which depict her accompanied by a large, watchful hound. Nehalennia was a divinity who protected travelers across  the North Sea and promoted their success in business. The baskets of fruit which accompany her suggest that she was a goddess of plenty. The dog may be a symbol of protection and fidelity.
