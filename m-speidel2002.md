Historian [Michael P. Speidel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael-P.-Speidel "Michael P. Speidel") has compared the fighting madness and dancing frenzy of the [Aztec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztecs "Aztecs") Quachics wolf-warriors with the Germanic mad wolf-warriors ([Berserks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker "Berserker")), and has argued that this could be due to shared historical origins–or perhaps a feature common to warrior societies: the more willing a warrior is to attack recklessly, the more useful he may be in battle.
