## Zoroastrian

The Zend Avesta imposes a sentence of Pesh√¥tanu (200 lashes) on a woman who, out of fear of discovery, "brings on menses" when conception occurs out of wedlock, with no mention of a penalty for the male.[Zend Avesta, Fargard 15 [13](http://www.hinduwebsite.com/sacredscripts/zoroscripts/fargard.asp#fargard15)] The Code of the Assura, c. 1075 BC has penalties for several different types of abortion crimes: if a woman aborts against her husband's wishes, if a man causes an abortion in any woman at the first stage of pregnancy; if a man causes an abortion in a harlot. In the first case, the woman is to be crucified; in the second, the man is fined two talents; and in the third, the man is to make restitution for a life.

The Visigothic Code had a system of punishments similar to that of the Zend Avesta, with 200 lashes for a woman causing her own abortion, or for a male slave performing an abortion on a freeborn woman, but with various fines in all other circumstances.[36] [_The Visigothic Code: (Forum judicum)_ ed.
