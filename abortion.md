This penalty, *peshô-tanva*, consisted of 200 lashes with a horse-whip (see [[darmesteter1898]]plxxxiii for more detail).

> If anyone should administer a potion to a pregnant woman to produce abortion, and the child should die in consequence, the woman who took such a potion, if she is a slave, **shall receive two hundred lashes**, and if she is freeborn, she shall lose her rank, and shall be given as a slave to whomever we may select.
