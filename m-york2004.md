## Abstract
Paganism, defined as a sacred religion with the tangible or sentient, might also be viewed as a spontaneous response to the world, the source of future religious expressions that are here divided into five main streams of devel- oped religion: gnostic, dharmic, Abrahamic and pagan. The essentially pagan response to the natural world is unconditioned by theology, is experi- ential and is concerned with an individualâ€™s transitions through life, as well as with the individual and communal encounter with the natural environ- ment.
