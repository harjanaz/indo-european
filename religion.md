This page is for religion itself (i.e. theories, "Religious Studies"). For reconstructed and historical religions (i.e. "The History of Religons" see [[religions]].

For organizational purposes, I define religion as culture + the [[sacred-divine]].

Organized by:
words, stories/narratives/myths
rituals
beliefs
