  Many wonderful things are told of, in the stories of old time
  of prizeworthy Heroes, of great trials
  of joy and festiveness, of weeping and of lament
  of keen warriors strifs, May you now wonders hear told.
  
  There grewup in Burgundy  such a-noble maiden,
  That in all the lands  non could match  her,
  Kriemhild was she called  and grew a fair woman
  And so there had to perish  later many a hero true.

Through whom high thanes a many / to lose their lives soon doom√©d were.
