	• Folk "people" from southeast Norway (around clearance cairns) who live parallel lives to humans (have families, go to church, etc)
		- Usually inhabit abandoned structures (abandoned due to the Black Death)
		- If you hear church-bells in the forest, it's them having mass
		
		○ Female: Huldra
			§ Beautiful

				□ Have a cow's tail, hidden in their skirt
			§ If a man married one it marked his family for generations to come
		○ Male
			§ Seem like normal men
			§ On Saturday nights they court dairy maids living on summer farms near cairn fields
			§ If a girl married one, they would have to move to their farm underground (where they would be unhappy, due to being separated from family)
