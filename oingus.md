# Oíngus
§ "Oenghus of the Birds was an Irish god of love"
§ "one of the Tuatha Dé Danann. He is known as 'mac Oc' ('the 'Young Son') because of the circumstances surrounding his birth to the Daghda and Boann....[he] was both conceived and born on the same day."
§ "[His] main role is as an aid to lovers in peril. 
§ "Like the welsh Mabon, Oenghus is the archetypal 'Young Man' or 'Divine Youth'."


Oengus mac Óg [OYN-ghus mahk OGE] His first name comes from the word ‘oen’ meaning ‘one’ and here denoting ‘singularity’ and ‘gus’ meaning ‘life force or virility.’ He is called ‘the Young Son’ (the Mac Óg) because he was conceived, gestated and born all in one day. When the Dagda and Boand united, the Dagda kept the sun in the sky for nine months (Boand’s husband, Elcmar, was away for the day). Oengus is a young man and warrior, and in some tales helps young lovers. He eventually inhabits Brug na Boinne (Newgrange).
