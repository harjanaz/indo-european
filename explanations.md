i have more detailed, no-necesarily-IE scholarship included about the scythians because they were such a large and not-easily-describable bunch of people compared to the norse.

there are other sites for germanic studies and classics.


This wiki includes pages on things related to the indo-europeans. As such it contains stricktly comparative pages, pages on inter-indo-european religions (like Mithraism), and difficult to pin down peoples (like the scythians). It DOES NOT contain detailed pages on specific IE branches. There are plenty of Germanic and Classical sites for that.

Some various exceptional specific pages

- indo-european


Works about more than one sub branch (ex. Proto-Germanic, or Pan-Germanic like a work on poetic inspiration across the Anglo-Saxon and Norse spheres; or, a work about Indo-Iranian topics)
