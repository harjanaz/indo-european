## Description
> The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture (or Tripolye culture) spanned the Neolithic the Copper Age and the early Bronze Age. They are one the of most impressive civilisations of Neolithic Europe. The culture extended from the Danube river basin to the Black Sea and the Dnieper. It encompassed the central Carpathian Mountains as well as the plains, steppe and forest steppe on either side of the range. Its historical core lay around the middle to upper Dniester. More than 3,000 cultural sites have been identified, ranging from small villages to the largest settlements in the world. 
> 
> The people of the late / post-Cucuteni–Trypillia culture appear in my Bronze Age fantasy novel *Godborn*.
