This site has three interconnected sections:

- [[biblio]]
- [[content]]


## Ex.
I wrap etymons (pokorny, watkins, etc) in buck's semantic fields which are in turn wrapped in content pages. For example:
- [[animals]] (content page with links to biblio pages)
	- [[buck-3.11-animal]] (semantic field)
		- pokonry-animal (etymon)
		- watkins-animal (etymon)

The content pages are further subdivided along linguistic family lines:
- pie
	- indo-iranian
		- indo-aryan
			- sanskrit

,ages:

- copper age
- bronze age
- iron age


,and every othe concievable hierarchical organizing pattern. I do this to create a hyper-interlinked yet also hyper-organized wiki structure. One can go "up" and "down" a page just as easily as you can go "side-to-side". Linguistics, archaeology, and history all interlink.
