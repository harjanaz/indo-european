#### The PIEs were Semi-Settled [Pastoralists](pastoralism) not Nomads
[[b-lincoln1981]]p9 criticised [[w-koppers]]:
> [He] vastly overemphasized the importance of the horse sacrifice for the Indo-Europeans and was thus led to compare them with the Turco-Mongols despite the fact that these are true nomads who range great distances, while the Indo-Europeans were semi-nomads who moved only relatively short distances at a time. [n45: The Turco-Mongols, in fact, own no cattle and are able to maintain their mobility only because of this fact. Even Schmidt, "Das Eigentum", p.206 insisted on the separation of horse herders and cattle herders. The I-E relationship to horses and cattle is somewhat similar to that of the North American Plains Indians to horses and buffalo: the former was highly important and much employed, but the latter was the means of subsistence. See [(f-roe1955p196)]((f-roe1955).md). There is, of course, the major difference that the I-E cattle were domestic, while the Indian's buffalo were not. Only the earliest Indo-Europeanists tended to see the Indo-Europeans as nomadic. Generaly, since P. Giles "The Aryans", in The Cambridge History of Indian, Vol 1. (Cambridge, 1929) p.60 most have recognized them as semi-settle pastoralists.]
