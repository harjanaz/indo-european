## Motif
> A sacred female associated with death and ravens/crows tells a negative prophecy of the future (i.e. speaks a vision of the apocalypse). Her vision is characterized by (1) the breaking of social bonds via violence and (2) the breakdown of social boundaries via incest.

## Branchs
- Germanic [[voluspa-44-brothr]] --> [[volu]], an seeress/witch raised from the dead by odin (who is himself associated with ravens) prophesizes that there will be violence and incest between kin.
- Celtic [[cath-maige-tuired-section-167]] --> [[badb]], a goddess associated with death and crows, prophesizes that there will be violence and incest between kin.

## Positive Flip Side
Atleast in the Irish, the same text ([[cath-maige-tuired]])  and same figure ([[badb]]) tells another [[era-vision]], only this time positive: [[cath-maige-tuired-819-820]] (i.e. [[motif-2-vision-of-positive-era]]).
