## Abstract
> This article reexamines Patroclus’s famous comment on Achilles’s cruelty in which the sea and the rocks take up the role of the latter’s parents (_Iliad_ 16.33–35). The verses reflect Near Eastern myths about the birth of menacing creatures from the sea and the rocks and are particularly associated with the _Song of Hedammu_ and the _Song of Ullikummi_ of the Hurro-Hittite tradition. Thematic, mythological, and dictional parallels among these texts are discussed in order to explore the existence of a common theme with specific connotations in the broader region of West Asia.
