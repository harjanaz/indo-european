# Ogma
Ogma [OHG-muh]. The meaning of this god’s name is not entirely clear, but John Carey has recently published an article in the journal Cosmos showing that his name and attributes appear to be connected with those of the Gaulish god known as Ogmios, known as both a strong-man / warrior and as a poet / god of eloquence. Similarly, in Irish sources Ogma is a beneficent warrior and champion of the Tuatha De Danann, and was also credited with the invention of the Ogam alphabet.
