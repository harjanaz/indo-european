## Abstract
> There is only one Slavic theonym which compares semantically with Celtic. Formal comparison is of course always possible in the framework of Comparative IE grammar, especially in word-formation. There is hardly anything like a privileged Slavo-Celtic relation. Irano-Slavica would be a more promising field for comparison indeed.
