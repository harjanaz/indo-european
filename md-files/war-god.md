> Some scholars have proposed a war god named *_Māwort-_ based on the Roman god Mars and the Vedic Marutás, the companions of the war-god Indra. Mallory and Adams reject this reconstruction on linguistic grounds ([[mallory-adams-d2006]]:410-411). Likewise, some researchers have found it more plausible that Mars was originally a storm deity, while the same cannot be said of Ares ([[york1988]]).
