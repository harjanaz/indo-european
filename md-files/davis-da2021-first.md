## Description
> The oldest myth in the world has its origins in the ice age and we see its descendants in the mythologies of Native American and European cultures. Native American mythology features a dog as an afterlife guardian as does Indo-European mythology (seen in Ancient Greek mythology as Cerberus and in Norse mythology as Garmr for example). To find out what ties these cultures together we look at dog burials in prehistoric Mesolithic Siberia and at the mammoth hunters of the Ice Age / Last Glacial Period the Mal'taâ€“Buret' culture. And we look at ancient human migration across Eurasia and the Ancient North Eurasians as we reconstruct through comparative mythology the prehistoric origins of this truly ancient myth.
