> "...the Muslim taboo on wine was connected less with the wish to avoid drunkenness, than with a shrewd concern to remove a traditional aid to motivation. For it was widely believed that, in his cups, the Arab gentleman could 'feel his blood speak'. Through wine, he became mindful of the deeds of his ancestors; he felt able to live up to an ancient style of life - lavish, polished and grandiloquent (not unlike that of the heroes of Homer or the *cortezia* of a medieval Provençal baron). The Muslim could not tolerate such easy spontaneity: not wine and warm memories of the past, but the chill dread of the Last Judgment, must spur on a man. [...But...] The Beduin way of life of the Arab aristocracy, though castigated by Muhammad, saved Islam." [[p-brown1971]]p139-40
