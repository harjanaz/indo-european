## Abstract
> The collocation “messenger of the gods” occurs both in Vedic (*devā́nāṃ dūtá*) and in Greek (θεῶν/ἀθανάτων ἄγγελος/κῆρυξ), referring to Agni and Hermes respectively. Neither element of the phraseological pair is etymologically related, but the hypothesis that the collocation springs from a common source is strengthened, on the one hand, by formally comparing it with two arguably inherited phrasemes: (i) *devā́nāṃ sádana-* :: θεῶν/ἀθανάτων ἕδος/ἕδρας ‘seat of the gods’ and (ii) *āśú- dūtá-* :: ἅγγελος ὠκύς ‘swift messenger’. The possibility that Hermes’ sphere of power, on the other hand, involves a few prerogatives akin to a fire-god is taken into consideration. If indeed Hermes and Agni share a couple of characteristics, a Graeco-Aryan origin seems all the more justified for the shared phrase.
