## "Abstract"
“To date…the structuralist-dialectic model has yielded few if any contributions to comparative mythology...I propose to demonstrate this broader applicability through a structural analysis of one of the most widespread and important of all ancient Old World theogonic themes, the so-called "kingship in heaven" theme...”.
