# The First Warrior
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_cosmogony#First_Warrior)

> After the world was made, the sky-gods gave cattle to "Third man" (`*Trito`). But the cattle were treacherously stolen by a three-headed, six-eyed serpent (`*NgÊ·hi`, the Proto-Indo-European root for negation). Third man entreated the storm god to help get the cattle back. Together they went to the cave (or mountain) of the monster, killed it (or the storm god killed it alone), and freed the cattle. *Trito became the first warrior. He recovered the wealth of the people, and his gift of cattle to the priests insured that the sky gods received their share in the rising smoke of sacrificial fires. This insured that the cycle of giving between gods and humans continued.
