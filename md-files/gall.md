***
- The PIE word for ‘gall’, g̑holo-, probably denoted both the organ (gall bladder) and its secretion (bile) [280], which was named after its color (cf. [173]). The belief that gall causes anger led to the metaphorical use of *g̑holo- as ‘wrath’ (: Gk. khólos, Germ. gallig ‘malicious’, etc.) {[[klein-et2017-20]]}
