#### Connection to Agni
- They are praised along side him in [[RV-8.007.32]]
- [[wirth1954]] sees them as followers of Angi-Trita, in an old belief of the birth of the Fire, the Light as the myth of the SUn. Sayana is also of the opinion that the verse 36 ([[RV-8.007.11]]?) refers to a Agni-maruta-Sacrifice. The light of Agni was born "first" (pūrvya). Only after that appears Indra, the Vrtra (winter) killer with his vajra, as the second welfare-bringer in the Vedas.

#### Warbands & Elites
- The "Mittanis/Hethite/Churrite" Indo-Iranians are reffered to as *marijanni* (in the Mitanni tablets?). This word is cogante with the RigVedic word *marya*  ("(young) man") which is used to describe the  [maruts](maruts.md). They are correlated, and modeled after each other.
- They correspond to the corresponds to the Umbric ***cerfo Martio***. War Dancers. Mars = Martis = Maruts = Germanic Maren/Mahrten = Morris-dancers = Cretan Kuretes = Phrygian korybants = [Roman Salier](roman-salier.md). They come from the PIE root ***mar-*** ("to die). The Korybants danced around the newborn Dionysos -- "The Son of Heaven/God" just as the Kuretes did, who danced around the "Zeus" child born of Rhea in the cave of Ida Mountain. The Battle God Mars is here a Hypostatsis of the old "Child of Heavens", of the "Son of Heaven and of Earth" who is the leader of the "Souls" and the God of Fertility. Thus he is called upon in the ancient cult of the Fratres Arvales, in the grove of Dea Dia, the serious goddess of the Romans, in the ancient sons of the soil toilers. (Max Mùller, H. Grassmann, L.v.
