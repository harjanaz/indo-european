> "Bhavani is regarded as having provided ShivaJi, the builder of the Maratha Empire, with both his Sword, as well as the accompanying Divine Mission to (re-)build Hindu Rashtra on the Subcontinent, at some point in the early-mid 1600s AD. And, following on from that, as an active force impelling the Marathas to victory over the Mughals and their lackeys." ([[rolinson2018-08-15]])
