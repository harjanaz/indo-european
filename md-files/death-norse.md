# Norse Afterlife

	• Barrows/mounds associated with Odin and Freyr (who himself was laid in a mound)
	• Angel of Death (played a leading role in Viking age cremation)


	• Ship Funeral
		○ Women burned with their husbands
		○ Sign of the Hammer
		○ Sacrifice of horses
		○ "Then the body of Balder was carried out on to the ship, and when his wide Nanna, the daughter of Nepr, saw this, her heart broke with grief and she died; she was carried to the pyre and laid in the flames. Thor stood beside the pyre and hallowed it with Mjollnir...Balder's horse was led to the pyre in all its trappings."
		○ Oseberg: 
			§ A royal barge was buried under a mound with the bodies of two women
			§ A wooden Freyr's wagon
			§ tapestry with Freyr's wagon
			§ Bucket of apples (golden apples are associated with Freyr)
			
Women were seen as primary religious authorities in tenth-century Denmark, a status celebrated in wagon burial. From The Cross Goes North Ed. Martin Carver


Anglo-Saxon Death

## Hell

## Valhǫll

## Fólkvangr

- "Army-plain"

> #### ***Grímnismál*** 14
> 
> *Fólkvangr er inn níundi*     Army-plain is the ninth,
> 
> *en þar Freyjaræðr*              and there Freya directs
> 
> *sessa kostum í sal.*             the sittings in the hall.
> 
> *Hálfan val*                             She half the fallen select
> 
> *hon kýss hver jan dag*        and kiss each day,
> 
> *en hálfan Óðinn á.*              but Odin the other half.

Odin is talking about the homes of the gods, Fólkvangr is the 9th. 

It's not clear that valhǫll and Fólkvangr are different places, they may be the same.

If Freyja = Frigg, then her as the wife of Odin choosing the seating arragments is a very normal action for a norse wife.

Snorri also quotes this

> #### ***Hárbarðsljóð*** 24
> 
> *...Óðinn á jarla*              Óðinn owns the jarls
> 
> *þá er í val falla,*              who fall in battle
> 
> *en þórr á þraela kyn.*    and þórr owns the þraela.

- This suggests that is you were not a noble, but died in battle, you would join þórr, perhaps in his hall Þrúðvangr ("power-field")

- Context: Odin is insulting Thor. We see in ***Gautreks saga*** that Odin is associated with the rich while Thor is associated with the middle & lower classes.

## Rán

> #### *Snorri*
> 
> *Rán átti net þat er hon*    Rán owns a net which
> 
> *veiddi í menn alla*            she catches all the men
> 
> *þa er á sae kómu.*            that come into the sea with.

> #### *Helgakviða Hjǫrvarðssonar* 18 or 19
> 
> *...ræsis rekka*                        ...the kings men
> 
> *er þú vildir Rán gefa,*            who you want to give to Rán,

- "Give to Rán" (i.e. drown in the sea)

> #### *Sonatorrek* 7
> 
> *Mjǫk hefr Rán*       Rán has much
> 
> *of rysktan mik...*   shaken me...

- Context: the speaker's two sons had just drowned.

## With Gefjun

> #### ***Snorri***
> 
> *Fjórða er Gefjun. Hon er mær, ok*
> 
> *henni þjóna þær er meyjar andask.*
> 
> "The fourth goddess is [Gefjun](gefjun.md). She is a virgin, and
> 
> those who die as virigins serve her."

- The "virgin" part directly contradicts the story in Snorri chapter 1, and by Loki's insults in ***Lokasenna***. Also, the verb he uses for "die" is *andask*, which is more common after conversion. So this may be influenced by the Christian notion that virginity is virtuous.

## Reincarnation

- In ***Gautreks saga*** some jelous berserkers insult Starkather and call him a *endrborinn jǫtunn* "again-born jǫtunn".

- Helki poems. Both ***Helgakviða Hjǫrvarðssonar*** and ***Helgakviða Hundingsbana II*** end saying that the hero and his valkyrie lover will be *endrborinn* "again-born".

> #### *Hundingsbana II??*
> 
> *þat var trúa í forneskjuat menn væri endribornir,*
> 
> *en þat er nú kǫlluð kerlingavilla.*
> 
> "It was a belief in the old times that people were again-born, but that is now called an old lady's superstition."
