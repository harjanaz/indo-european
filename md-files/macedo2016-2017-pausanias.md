## Abstract
> The project will concentrate on the study of the divine epithets (or epicleses) attested in Pausanias and in the collection of the so-called Orphic Hymns. It is our aim to give an exhaustive account of every epiclesis within this corpus and analyze the most interesting examples in religious and linguistic terms, searching for parallels in epigraphic, lexicographic, and literary texts. As far as we can see, no study has yet been undertaken within this specific corpus nor has the scope of the investigation - devoted both to religious and linguistic issues - been previously set by scholars working in the field. After gathering the relevant data, we shall proceed to classify the epicleses according to the deity being addressed, their semantic features (generic or specific, distinctive or descriptive, etc.), their grammatical traits (adjective or noun, simple or compound noun, type of compound, word formation, etc.), the contentious etymologies, and so forth. Details regarding religious and linguistic matters will be dealt with at greater length whenever the epiclesis involved lends itself to further elaboration. Individual charts for each of the two main corpora under issue (Pausanias and the Orphic Hymns) will be drawn in order to assess their peculiarities as well as their relationship with material stemming from epigraphy, lexica, scholia, and literary documents.
