## Abstract
> Part of the funeral rites, which is occurred even today in communities that have come down from the Christian areas of northern highlands of Albania, is what is known as the Men's Lament (Gjama). This phenomenon occurs in the Dukagjin area or in communities that have moved from this area and living in the suburbs of Albanian cities. Men's lament is a rite that has begun a long time ago. Few Albanian scholars have talked about this phenomenon and have tried to explain and describe it. My goal was, and is to give a contribution in the field that has as an object of study this subject, because as well as previous works are not exhaustive and have had or not as their object the field research. I would say that precisely at this point there is my priority, since most of my work related to the study of this phenomenon; I have done in the field, having the opportunity to be part of the funeral ceremonies, to record them, and also to interview and photograph the men who lamented. I have also the opportunity of observation of numerous recordings of laments, certainly late recordings, of the period after the 90s, which have helped me to estimate and to judge more clearly about this phenomenon. Of course, men’s lament has changed until today. It is already performed as a part of the meaningful tradition and identity of communities which execute it.

> The men's lament known as Gjama e Burrave is a ritual executed by a group of men which is known also as s dance, a dance of grief. The Call of these lamenters is so deep and melancholic. They perform by beating the breasts, scratching the face, giving a perfect imitation of frantic grief. All this is documented by me. I filmed this ritual and I also interviewed different lamenters.

> In the meantime, as Aleksandar Stipčević (Croatian archeologist, bibliographer, librarian, and historian who specialized in the study of the Illyrians) wrote, the death rituals are known in different Balkan areas as Dance of Serpent. From this point of view, I will see the study of the men's grief also from the ethological perspective.

> The Cult of the Dead, Cult of Ancestors is well known from the Illyrian times. This Cult of Dead remained alive specially in the communities who used to live in the mountains of North Albania. The men's grief (gjama e burrave) is the most important moment of the death ritual, is the rite of passage which stresses the liminal moment in which the lamenters help the Spirit to pass from this life in the other life in which the ancestors (Cult of the Dead) wait for the dead person.

> As the final part of my presentation, I will make a specific explanation about the Symbol of Serpent through the Illyrian tribes until today. The Serpent was something people feared and worshiped. It is also a totem, a magic fighter, a magic maker, and Chthonic Deity. Serpent as Chthonic Deity is very strongly and deeply related to the concept of Death.

> The Serpent used to be and still is (in northern mountains of Albania) an important part of death ritual. It is said that the Serpent as the guardian of the house is also the guardian of the grave. The Serpent waits for the dead in the other life as the most important of Chthonic Animals.

> In my paper, among others I will analyze the Illyrian belief in the underworld where the dead spirits went to, as in Greek mythology. The duality of the Serpent Symbol, as good and bad at the same time. **The Illyrian Serpent is an Indo-European myth, the same as the origin of Illyrian tribes is**.
