> The mother goddess feeds the gods, and she herself had to be nurtured in the beginning of time. Thus, however indirectly, we probably witness traces of a cosmogonic myth where a child-goddess is fed with the sacrificial food, made from the contents of *codal* (skin, hide), and when grown up feeds the gods while the whole land of Ireland is manifested as her own body.

> Similar interrelations of goddess, food, and mountain are to be found on the opposite end of the Indo-European world, in India, where one of the names of Chiva's spouse, Dūrga, was Annapūrṇā (filled with or possessed of food), and the name is also applied to one of the highest mountains in the Himalayas.
