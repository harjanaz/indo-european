## Abstract
> his essay compares the Norse deity Heimdallr to the Vedic and Iranian Apā́ṃ Nápāt. Parallels between these two deities include being born to multiple mothers and association with fire in water and with a cosmic life-giving tree, gold, and horses. Comparisons to other Indo-European deities and mythological figures such as Nechtan, Morann, Poseidon and Neptune are also considered. This essay argues, however, that the primary goal of comparative mythology should not be merely to reconstruct a proto-myth, but rather to understand why inherited material was interpreted so differently in various historical and social contexts.
