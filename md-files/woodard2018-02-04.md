## Excerpts
>"§21. In its relative rarity in Greek the *-e/ono- suffix fundamentally parallels the status of the related formant *-no-. An examination of Greek *-no- reflexes can be found in [[woodard2018-03-15]]. Suffice it to say, concisely, in the present discussion that these reflexes significantly populate the vocabulary of religion and that **preservation of these several forms must surely be another expression of the tendency of early Indo-European languages to cling to the ancestral lexicon of cult speech with particular tenacity**, as observed by [[vendryes1918]].

> "§24. In conclusion, the interpretation of Linear B _po-re-na_ as a Mycenaean athematic infinitive _phorēnai_ (φορῆναι) is consistent not only with an Indo-European syntagmatic pattern and a linguistic feature of the closely related Arcadian dialect, but is also consistent with the analysis of _po-re-si_ as a dative plural, specifically _phor-en-si_ (φορ-εν-σι), the dative plural of the athematic participle of _phorēnai_ (φορῆναι), of a type attested in both Arcadian and Aeolic. The interpretation of one form informs that of the other. _Po-re-no-_, in contrast, preserves a primitive Indo-European morphology. Read as a nominal _phoreno-_ (φορενο-), cognate with Sanskrit _bharaṇa__–_, the Mycenaean form is likely inherited from the liturgical language of Proto-Graeco-Indo-Iranian tradition, if not from that of an earlier period."
