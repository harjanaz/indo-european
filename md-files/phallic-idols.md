Italic | Varro's [Liber](liber.md) paraded on a cart. ["Among other rites which I am compelled to pass over due to their sheer number, there are certain rites of Liber that Varro says are celebrated at Italian crossroads with such shameful abandon that the private parts of the male are worshipped in the god’s honour, and not even in secret, out of some deference to modesty, but openly and with wantonness running riot. Yes indeed, during Liber’s festal days this disgusting member would be exhibited on a waggon with great honour, and carried first around the crossroads in the countryside, and then brought all the way into the city. In the town of Lavinium they even dedicated a whole month to Liber, and during these days they all used such disgraceful language until that member had been carried through the forum and come to rest in its own place. Then the most respectable woman, a mother of a family, had to place a garland on said dishonourable member. In this way, supposedly, the god Liber was to be propitiated so that all would turn out well with the seeds; in this way the hex needed to be warded off the fields…"] |[[city-of-god]]:7.21.2–4 <br> [[ard]]:262 /42 
Norse | [Freyr](freyr.md)'s wooden phallus idols paraded on a wagon |

- **Ancient [[interpretatio]] Support**: Strabo & Pseudo-Apollodorus both mention pillars of "dionysus" in India (by which they probably meant Shiva). Roman Liber was the interpretatio Greek Dionysus.
