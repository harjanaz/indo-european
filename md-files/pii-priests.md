[[pii-religion]], [[priests]]

---

- They were itinerant, not fixed to any specific place or dedicated to any specific deity.

## Kinds
[[pii-pourer-priests]] (most important)
[[pii-seer-priests]]
[[pii-fire-priests]]
[[pii-combat-priests]]

These different kinds of priests were not distinguished by their devotion to different gods, but rather by their employment of different ritual techniques and concerns. They were generalists, capable of performing sacrifice to any of the deities (although they might have had some personal preferences).
