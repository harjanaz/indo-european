## Abstract
> In the present study the designations of “year” and its seasons are summarized in all Indo-European branches, analyzed from the point of view of their word-formation, internal reconstruction and etymology. For typological comparison the external parallels from language families in the neighborhood of Indo-European are surveyed. Some of these indicate which terms could be inherited from older stages of development of the Indo-European protolanguage and which represent innovation.
