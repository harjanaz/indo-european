> The two divine horses that draw the chariot of Ēōs, goddess of the dawn, are here named as _Phaéthōn_ and _Lámpōn_. These names, both referring to the radiance of the sun, are parallel to the names for the two daughters of Hēlios, god of sunlight, who are _Phaéthousa_ and _Lampetíē_. See also the comment at O.12.132. As already noted there, these four names and the myths linked with them reflect mythological traditions that can be reconstructed by way of Indo-European linguistics.
