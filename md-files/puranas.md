## Date
According to the Indologists [J. A. B. van Buitenen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._A._B._van_Buitenen "J. A. B. van Buitenen") and Cornelia Dimmitt, the Puranas that have survived into the modern era are ancient but represent "an amalgam of two somewhat different but never entirely different separate oral literatures: the Brahmin tradition stemming from the reciters of the Vedas, and the bardic poetry recited by Sutas that was handed down in Kshatriya circles".[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puranas#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDimmittvan_Buitenen20127-28) The original Puranas comes from the priestly roots while the later genealogies have the warrior and epic roots.
