## Etymology of her name and its connection to an epithet of the dawn goddess
> Wiktionary:
> "In an older position now rejected a Greek etymology is proposed [for [Aphrodítē](aphrodite.md)] connecting -δίτη (-dítē) with the verb δέατο (déato, “to shine, to appear, seem”) (Homeric δῆλος (dêlos, “visible, conspicuous, clear”)[originally from PIE [*dyew-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/dyew-) "bright; sky, heaven") and interpret the name as originating from an epithet of the dawn goddess Ἠώς (Ēṓs)."
