### Creation Narrative
### Priests & Sacrifice
### Interpreting the pantheon
Scholars have interpreted the pantheon in a variety of ways:
1. as personified abstractions of a moral nature ([[p-thieme1957]])
2. as expressing cosmic dualism  ([[kuiper]])
3. as a projection of the household ([[bailey1975]])
4. as a projection of a tripartite class system ([[dumezil1945]])

Lincoln ([[lincoln1981]]p11-12n56) critiqued these 4 theories, saying they focused too much on gods and not enough on myth, ritual, etc.

### Pastoralism
They, compared to the other IE branches, best preserved PIE pastoralism. [[lincoln1981]]p6n27
