# Conall
§ "[He] is the son of Amhairghin the poet and Fionnchaomh, daughter of the druid Cathbadh."
§ "'Conall' means 'strong as a wolf'; 'Cernach' means 'victorious'."
§ "He is the guardian of Ireland's boundaries and is clearly an ancestor-deity of part of the land."
§ "...like Ferghus, he is a foster-father and tutor to Cù Chulainn"
§ "...the epitome of the Irish champion..."
§ "...at the Feast of Bricriu (an Otherworld banquet), he boasts that he always sleeps with the severed heap of a Connacht-man beneath his knee...he is described as wearing the head of Connacht's best warrior at his belt."
§ "...one tale relates his attack on a fort whose treasure is guarded by a great serpent. An affinity between hero and snake is displayed when the creature dives into Conall's waist-band and neither harms the other."
