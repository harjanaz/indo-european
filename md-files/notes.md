In the first place, it is unmistakeably evident that Indo-European religiosity is not rooted in any kind of fear, neither in fear of the deity nor in fear of death. The words of the latter-day Roman poet, that fear first created the Gods (Statius: Thebais, III, 661: primus in orbe fecit deos timor), cannot be applied to the true forms of Indo-European religiosity, for wherever it has unfolded freely, the “fear of the Lord” (Proverbs, ix. 10; Psalms, cxi. 10) has proved neither the beginning of belief nor of wisdom.

Fear could not arise because the Indo-European does not consider that he is the creature of a deity; he neither regarded himself as a “creature” nor did he comprehend the world as a creation — the work of a creative God with a beginning in time. To him the world was far more a timeless order, within which both Gods as well as men had their time, their place and their office. The idea of creation is Oriental, above all Babylonic, like the idea — coming from Iran, but not from the Indo-Aryan spirit — of the world’s end, culminating in a judgment and the intercession of a kingdom of God, in which everything will be completely transformed.

After the ageing Plato had taken over, in Timaeus, certain features of the oriental theory of creation, legends for the explanation of the origin of the world, his pupil Aristotle (Concerning the Heavens, edited by Paul Gohlke, 1958, pp. 26-27) re-established the Indo-European outlook: the world totality is “without becoming, it is intransitory, eternal, without alteration, without growth or diminution”.

	Fire
	In the Northern myths there are several Gods connected with fire, mainly Heimdallr, Balder and Loki. Some say that Balder is the inner fire, Loki the destructive fire and Heimdallr (the ‘father’ of both) the fire that connects our world with the world above. Also in the Hindu myths there are several deities connected with fire, but it is Agni that rises his head above the surface. “Agni is all that burns, or devours, or digests: sun, heat, stomach, lust, and passion. (p. 63/4). Agni can be applied to any of the Northern fire gods. “Only through Fire can the gods be reached” (Heimdallr); “The inner fire which pervades the body of the earth (prithivi-pinda) is called the fire-of-immortality (amrita agni).” (p. 67) (Balder); “the fire of destruction” (p. 89) (Loki). The Hindu Agni is the ‘father’ of ten forms of fire, so if you agree with the theory that Heimdallr is the ‘first fire’ of the Northern myths, these two may be compared. But still: “According to the Mahabharata (12.10364), Shiva is called “the white one” (p. 214). How beautifully this reminds of the “white ase” Heimdallr.
	Creation
	Brahma is both “the Immense Being” (p. 232) as “the active creator” (p. 233). “But since Brahma represents a polarized immensity, his name has a gender. he is the first personal stage of existence.” (p. 233) “The personified creator appears to arise from the polarizations of the abstract impersonal Brahman. The pure Brahman is beyond-quality. Only when “spotted through by the power of illusion” does it become the qualified-Brahman, immanent cause of the universe.” (p. 233) Daniélou suddenly uses “Brahman” and “Brahma”, but since Brahman lives upto my idea of the Etenal Divinity, this is only for the better.
	“The illusion which is movement or action appears as the original, the Nonevolved, form of Nature. In other terms, the reflection-of-consciousness deposited within the passive nonevolved Nature (i.e., Vishnu or the womb) before the creation of the universe by the transcendent Lord, the active power (i.e., Shiva) or giver of seed, is the first indivudual being, the Self-born-Immense-Being (Svayambhu-Brahma), who dwells in the unmanifest city, the abstract plan of the universe, as the source of the Cosmos and of the perceptible worlds. From him all the forms of existence arise.” (p. 233)
	If we compare this to the stories of creation in the Eddas, would it be farfetched to see “Vishnu or the womb” as Ginnungagap, “the active power (Shiva)” as the force that brings the fire and the ice together and “Svayambhu-Brahma”, Ymir?? Daniélou does give some information about creation in the Hindu context, but most elements are not much like what we know from the Eddas. “purusha”, “the Supreme-Man” may remind of Ymir too, things are made out of “a body” but not quite like in the Eddas. The daughter of Brahma is “Speech” or “Vach”, appears as a wish-cow and is identified with the Cosmos, p. 260). There are more cows in the creation-myths, but again, not quite like the role of Audhumla.
	Other
	ust as in the Northern European thinking, the Hindus recognise three worlds (but also seven), it is ‘this three’ that Dumézil found in all Indo-European religions. Our Örlögr or Eternal Law is Sanathana Dharma (and sometimes also the Vedas) in Hinduism. Yggdrasil or the Cosmic Tree has his brother in Ashvatta (p. 370), both words contain the word “horse”, “drasil” (“Yggr’s horse” is a translation for “Yggdrasil”) and Asva in the Hindu tree).  The demon Rashi devours the sun (p. 99) like a wolf eats the sun of the Norsemen. The Brihad-aranyaka Upanishad has the stange stopgap “did you understand”, just like “do you understand yet, or what more?” (Larrington) from the Völuspa.
	
	“The chief temple of the Hindu is the universe. It is in the forests, the mountains, on the bank of rivers, under the shade of certain trees, or in his own house that he performs all the daily ceremonial of worship, all prayer, all meditation.
	[…]
	Temples are, however, of secondary importance. They are not, as in some religions, the meetingplaces of the faithful but are the homes of deities, places where a particular aspect of Divinity is honoured, worshipped by priests who are its servants. people go to the temple as they go to visit a saintly man or a sacred place of a renowed scholar. They pay homage to the image and offer flowers and incense. But if there were none of these sacntuaries Hindu life and its rituals would in no way be affected.” (p. 376)
	“The household fire was the image of the cosmic fire.” (p. 68)
	“We cannot live without taking part in the cosmic ritual either as instruments or as victims. Yet that part is positive only when we do it consciously and with the proper knowledge of forms and utterances. Through the voluntary ritual of sacrifice man takes his place in the cosmic symphony as an equal. The main purpose of existence is the performance of this ritual.” (p. 67)
	
	COMMENTS
	For example in the Rig Veda, the god of the wind (Vayu or Vata) comes from the breath of Purusha (the equivalent of Ymir) when he is sacrificed. Vata means wind in Vedic Sanskrit. The same root if found in the Gaulish/Gallic word ‘vates’, Latin ‘vatis’, Greek ‘ouateis’, etc. all these words mean ‘seer/prophet’ and have become Woden/Wotan/Odin through various alterations. Funnily, even ‘vatican’ comes from the same root. Of course, it doesn’t mean all these words derive from Vedic Sanskrit but that Latin, Sanskrit, Avestan, Celtic, Old Norse, etc. all derive from PIE (Proto-Indo-European).
	
	In Bhagavata purana it is described that whole Univers is created from lord Vishnu’s body, from his body hair trees were made, from his veins rivers, from his bones mountians, ect. From Ymir gods creted all, from his hair trees, from his blood water, from his bones hills, etc.

	The one-eyed god: Odin and the (Indo- )Germanic Männerbünde
	By: Kershaw, Priscilla K..
	Journal of Indo-European Studies
	2000
	Page 253:
	Kali is one-eyed because the Kali outcome is one eye/nut. The vibhídaka nuts are eye-shaped, but any small, dark object which is round or ovoid will suggest an eye, as will dots on an astrologos or cube: in Old Norse and modern Scandinavian languages, as in German, the pips on the dice are "eyes." And this, I believe, is why Odin, the wild necromancer god of the North, is one eyed. The leader is chosen by the one-eye result, and the one-eyed god enters into him: he becomes the one-eyed god.
	This is the reason Odin is one-eyed. Not that he is missing one eye, or that he does or doesn't have an eye patch. myth follows Ritual, not the other way around. That he is One-Eyed speaks to us of a ritual. That Thor is Red-Beareded, speaks to us of a ritual. That (EDIT: Freya) wears the Brisingamen, that Frigg weeps for her murdered son; all of these speak to ritual actions the reasons for which have been forgotten.

	GAULISH WORDS ABOUT SIN, from polytheist.com, main source: Matasovic
	
	Salâ: Dirt, filth, impurity. This is the mundane word for dirt, in the sense of being unclean, not of “soil”. It also appears to have referred to spiritual impurity.1 It is less value laden than most similar words in other religions, being quite uncomplicated in meaning. There is little surviving lore on what brings salâ, except that, as in other traditions, it appears to have been associated with mundane dirtiness. It is possible that war either created salâ, or else moved participants into a liminal state from which they needed to be reintegrated with society.2 In addition, it is my UPG that excrement created salâ.
	Salâcos: The adjectival form of salâ, meaning dirty, filthy, impure.3 There is not a lot to say about this one that hasn’t already been said about the noun.
	Troxos: Leprous.4 From the connotations of some of the descendent words, we might take this as referring also to being in a state of spiritual contagion, but it is far from clear. If so, the nominal form is troxiâ.
	Glânos: Clean, clear, pure.5 The opposite of salâcos. This state is obtained by:
	Glânosagon: Purification. I have already discussed one method in my ritual outlines. Other methods include: “fire, juniper, whiskey, silver, milk, prayer, water….”6
	Culos: Sin, violation.7 The sense here is of a violation of the law, a crime, an unlawful act. It has none of the connotation of “disobedience to God”, “original sin”, or “being in a state of sin” conveyed by the Christian version of “sin”. The term for law in proto-Celtic and Gaulish is rextus, also meaning “right”8, and so culos can be seen as a wrong act, as well. In most Celtic traditions, it is corrected by restitution to the victims, though the Gauls did have the death penalty for murder and other especially heinous offences.
	Meblâ: Shame.9 This is the term for the state into one falls after an evil, unvirtuous act. It is, essentially, a loss of eniequos or clutos as a result of one’s own actions. It can only be corrected by living such that one’s reputation is restored.
	This about sums up the Gaulish vocabulary of impurity and sin. It is fairly simple, all in all. Salâ is nearly unavoidable, in the course of a day’s sweat and dirt, but of no moral consequence. If you just wash up, put on clean(ish) clothes, and perform glânosagon before ritual, you will be fine. Culos and Meblâ are far more serious matters, but, again, do not equate well to sin. They can be corrected by living according to uiriâ and uiridios, as well as making up for one’s offenses against others.
	
	--------------
	MUSLIM ACCOUNTS OF VIKINGS:
-Every man is tatooed from finger nails to neck with dark green (or green or blue-black) trees, figures, etc.
	-Each woman wears on either breast a box of iron, silver, copper or gold; the value of the box indicates the wealth of the husband. Each box has a ring from which depends a knife. The women wear neck rings of gold and silver, one for each 10,000 dirhems which her husband is worth; some women have many. Their most prized ornaments are beads of green glass of the same make as ceramic objects one finds on their ships. They trade beads among themselves and they pay an exaggerated price for them, for they buy them for a dirhem apiece. They string them as necklaces for their women.
	-It is also believed that Norse men and women wore dark makeup around their eyes to protect their eyes from their glare of the sun off snow and water, just as the Egyptians did in the desert.
	-They [the Vikings] highly valued pork. Even those who had converted to Islam aspired to it and were very fond of pork.

- ON LOKI  https://metal-gaia.com/category/norse-2/
Yet despite Loki’s mischief, the fact remains that Odin and Loki were blood brothers – a very serious bond deeper than any other. Perhaps this is because Odin saw Loki as being useful, when a job required brains and negotiating, rather than brawn. I have even heard interesting theories that there was a deeper motivation behind Loki’s mischief than people think (I emphasize the word theories here). As mentioned earlier, Loki was responsible for keeping Baldur trapped in the Underworld. However, in the aftermath of Ragnarok, Baldur emerged from the Underworld to return to the land of the living where he and his brother Höðr would rule the new earth together with Thor’s sons. Had Baldur not been trapped in the Underworld, he may have died in Ragnarok. So was there a method behind Loki’s madness? Who knows…
But perhaps the point of Loki was that the Norse saw the world in a much more nuanced way than we do today. The world wasn’t simply a place of good and evil. The world was a place where courage and bravery were ideal, but even so – sometimes there were situations that called for a little trickery, trickery that yielded results that were good, bad and highly comedic.

The Well and the Tree

Wednesday, February 27, 2019
9:59 AM

Foreword----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	"Yggdrasil is called by different names in different places. Our interest is not in giving full accounts of all of these but in examining those elements that are common to all representations. Then, and only then, we may begin to see how the remaining distinctions among these may operate to point up particularly important relations not obvious in the repetitions themselves. There are, for example, three wells at the base of Yggdrasil: Urth's Well, which is most obviously the well of the 'past'; Mímir's Well, which is the well of wisdom, and Hvergelmir, the well that is 'serpent-infested' and that 'seethes'. All three wells suggest fluidity, accumulation, and containment among other elements. What their juncture uniquely signals in this case is a meaningful joining of 'wisdom' with a 'past' that, although exhibiting something of 'containment', still 'writhes' like a serpent and 'seethes'. Further analysis of other aspects of the culture shows additional significant joining of these same features. When the well and tree are joined, significant elements begin to appear as a result of that joining as well. 
	It is clear, too, from such analysis that not every element that appears in any configuration will be 'distinctive' in the sense outlined above. (This is also true for the kind of phonological analysis just described.) Some features are necessary to create the figure but have no special relevance beyond the surface construct itself. Thus, the wells beneath Yggdrasil contain 'water', but it is not the chemical composition or idea of water that is important. Rather, it is the idea of 'fluidity' inherent in liquid, of which water is the most common type, and its relation to 'flow' and 'movement' that is repeated and becomes distinctive. Other configurations may significantly replace water with blood or intoxicant; indeed, any item or action expressive of 'fluid motion' or 'liquid activity' will contain the same iconic quality. Likewise, with respect to the tree Yggdrasil, its kind (genus) is not a distinctive element. In some texts, it is merely 'a tree'; in others, it is specifically askr 'ash'; in some, it is apparently some kind of evergreen; in still others, it is of an 'unknown' kind. There are problems if we wish to see it as both a 
	deciduous ash and as 'ever green'. All of this is ultimately of no significance. Only natural trees functioning iconically pose problems. Other semantic elements expressed by the figure of a 'tree' will provide the distinctions here. Comparison of representations allows for the resolution of such apparent contradictions." 
	
	Notes:
		2: A word of warning in advance: The description of the Germanic cosmos that follows operates with a series of fundamental binary factors, usually significantly opposed: past/present, fact/process, well/tree, etc. Lest these be misread, it should be stated here that they have little to do with Lévi-Strauss's structural concept of binary opposition. The whole structural methodology that LéviStrauss has so successfully employed in his own work is largely absent from everything that follows here. Although certain elements similar to those of LéviStrauss--like the presence or absence of particular semantic elements--are occasionally employed, they do not reflect the opposition of nature and culture that is central to all of Lévi-Strauss's investigations.

Notes:
	4: [ør-] The prefix is common in all Germanic languages. In addition to Old Norse it occurs in Goth. us-, ur-, in OHG and Ger. ur-, in OS ur-, or-, in Middle and Modern Dutch oor-, and in Old English, where it was quite common. It is now obsolete in English except for its persistence in ordeal. 'The primary sense was "out", as in Goth. and OHG úrruns "outrunning, exit, exodus", ON órför outgoing, departure; thence various derived senses, of which [Old English] had "out, completely, to an end", as in orþanc "thinking ont" . . . , "skill", . . . orie lda"extreme old age"; . . . orзiete "clearly perceptible, manifest", [etc.]' (OED). The relationship of the prefix to outer limits and extremities is further exemplified by the remarks in Grimm and Grimm ( 1936:2355-59), where it is related to Skt. ud 'hinauf, hinaus' (2355). Ultimately the prefix comes to express '[die] bezeichnung des ersten, anfänglich vorhandenen, ursprünglichen, unabgeleiteten, originalen, primitiven, unverfälschten, reinen' (2358). 
	5: …de Vries ( 1971), who traces the Dutch form oorlog to *uzlaga: 'datgene war uitgelegd is' (491). In Dutch, oorlog now means 'war, contention, strife'. The development moves, according to de Vries, from 'that which is laid out' to noodlot 'destiny, fate', i.e. 'that which is laid out by necessity'. Thus, 'wat her eerste aangaat, mag men er aan herinneren, dat de strijd als een godsoordeel opgevat werd en dus een noodlotsbeschikking was' (491). From the 'necessity of strife' to simple 'strife' itself marks the development into Modern Dutch.

# The Barbarian Conversion
By: Richard Fletcher

"The rich diversity of pre-Christian cults with which evangelists had to contend shared a core of what sociologists of religion like to cll "empiracle religiosity". That is to say, the belief that proper cult bings tangible reward in this present world, in material benefits like health, prosperity, sucess or fame, as well as in whateer hereafter traditional religion might have envisaged. Edwin wanted victory in battle, glory and treasure and power and the continued loyalty of his retainers. Others of less exalted status would have had different hopes and xpectations: enough food to see the family through the winter, murrain-free cattle, cures for sickness or disability, a good husband or wife, successful trading, deliverance from shipwreck, release from enchantment, protection against evil spirits, the death of an enemy, revenge, freedom, a return home." p.6-7

	• Information was fragmentary and orally transmitted (as opposed to written and universally available like with the Romans) p.31
	• did mot acquire writing  till the fifth century ad.” P.31
	
	• Illiteracy is the norm for humans
	• Celts had an advanced eloquence oral technique, and trained memories “cultivated to a degree undreamed of among readers of books” p.33
	• Thoughts were clothed in an artificial form (ex. Poetry, allusion, hyperbole, and grandiloquent language) to serve as a vehicle for transmission (ex. Irish retoric, early british heroic age poetry, skaldic poetry) p.33
	
	• Romans trained in/under Celtic rhetoric/rhetoricians p.34

“The word mantra means that which has been thought or known or that which is privately—or even secretly by initiation (disksa)—transmitted and which possesses power to liberate.  It is sacred speech, sacrificial formula, efficient counsel. [Thus Sanskrit mantric, king’s counselor (from mantra). The root is obviously man-, to think. Df. manas, mind] The Brhadaranyaka Upanisad explains how the world came into being by the union of Mind (manas) with Word (vāc) [Śiva and śakti, or binds and nāda in Tantrism, are related to this] Faith, understanding, and physical utterance, as ell as physical continuity (the mantra has to be handed down by a master), are essential requites for an authentic mantra.
