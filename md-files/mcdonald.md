## Biographical Sketch 
From [[mcdonald2014]]
> John McDonald began his undergraduate studies in 1999 at the University of Alberta, where he did coursework in Classics and in Germanic languages. It is during his studies at the University of Alberta that he discovered the discipline of comparative Indo-European mythology. This discovery had an immediate and profound impact on his scholarly interests, and has informed and inspired his scholarship since then. In 2001, he transferred to the University of Toronto so as to be able to train in various Indo-European languages not taught at the University of Alberta, languages spoken by cultures possessing mythological traditions rich in elements inherited from Indo-European. In 2003, John earned his B.A. with a double major in Classics and Medieval Studies from the University of Toronto. He then spent the following year as a special student at the University of Toronto, doing coursework in linguistics, which had been lacking in his undergraduate education.

> In 2004, John commenced graduate studies in Classics at the University of Georgia, where he trained in historical and comparative Indo-European linguistics with Jared Klein. Having earned his M.A. in Classics from the University of Georgia in the spring of 2006, John proceeded in the August of that same year to begin his Ph.D. in Classics at Cornell University. Upon having obtained the status of doctoral candidate in the spring of 2009, he went to spend 2009â€“2011 as a visiting scholar at Harvard University, studying with several experts in ancient Indo-European languages, and beginning to write his dissertation with the guidance of these mentors. In August 2011, he returned to Cornell to complete his dissertation, which he successfully defended in August 2013. John earned his Ph.D. in Classics from Cornell in the spring of 2014.
