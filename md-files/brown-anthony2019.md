## Wikipedia Summary

> Since the term 'Ancient North Eurasian' refers to a genetic bridge of connected mating networks, scholars of [comparative mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative-mythology "Comparative mythology") have argued that they probably shared myths and beliefs that could be reconstructed via the comparison of stories attested within cultures that were not in contact for millennia and stretched from the [Pontic-Caspian steppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontic-Caspian-steppe "Pontic-Caspian steppe") to the [American continent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas").
>  
> For instance, the [mytheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mytheme "Mytheme") of the dog guarding the [Otherworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherworld "Otherworld") possibly stems from an older Ancient North Eurasian belief, as suggested by similar motifs found in [Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European-mythology "Proto-Indo-European mythology"), [Native American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native-American-religion "Native American religion") and [Siberian mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism-in-Siberia "Shamanism in Siberia"). In [Siouan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siouan-languages "Siouan languages"), [Algonquian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian-peoples "Algonquian peoples"), [Iroquoian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois "Iroquois"), and in Central and South American beliefs, a fierce guard dog was located in the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky-Way "Milky Way"), perceived as the path of souls in the afterlife, and getting past it was a test. The Siberian [Chukchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chukchi-people "Chukchi people") and [Tungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungusic-peoples "Tungusic peoples") believed in a guardian-of-the-afterlife dog and a spirit dog that would absorb the dead man's soul and act as a guide in the afterlife. In Indo-European myths, the figure of the dog is embodied by [Cerberus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus "Cerberus"), [Sarvarā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharvara "Sharvara"), and [Garmr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garmr "Garmr").[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient-North-Eurasian#cite-note-FOOTNOTEAnthonyBrown2019104–105-19) [Anthony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David-W.-Anthony "David W. Anthony") and Brown note that it might be one of the oldest mythemes recoverable through [comparative mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative-mythology "Comparative mythology").
>  
> A second canid-related series of beliefs, myths and rituals connected dogs with healing rather than death. For instance, Ancient Near Eastern and [Turkic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic-peoples "Turkic peoples")\-[Kipchaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kipchaks "Kipchaks") myths are prone to associate dogs with healing and generally categorised dogs as impure. A similar myth-pattern is assumed for the Eneolithic site of [Botai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botai-culture "Botai culture") in Kazakhstan, dated to 3500 BC, which might represent the dog as absorber of illness and guardian of the household against disease and evil. In Mesopotamia, the [Nintinugga Gula](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nintinugga-Gula&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nintinugga Gula (page does not exist)"), associated with healing, was symbolized by a dog. Similar absorbent-puppy healing and sacrifice rituals were practiced in Greece and Italy, among the [Hittites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittites "Hittites"), again possibly influenced by Near Eastern traditions.
