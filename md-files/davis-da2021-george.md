## Description
> Saint George was a Christian Greek soldier of the Roman Empire, from Cappadocia or perhaps Syria who was martyred for refusing to sacrifice to the Roman gods. He was a heroic figure to people right across Christendom and one who was particularly attractive to soldiers because he had been one himself. The serpent as a symbol in stories and art represents the external, the other, the great enemy, the demons, the evil that wants nothing but to destroy us. And the dragon-slayer therefore represents order, stability, continuity. He is the strong arm of the mighty that keeps chaos at bay.
