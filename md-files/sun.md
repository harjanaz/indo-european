## Chinese Connection
   Several Chinese goddesses are similar to the PIE sun goddes and the dawn goddes, implying influence from them through trade routes in Tocharian territories and therefore their worship there (j-snow2002).
## Tocharian
   Tocharian: A *koṃ*, B *kauṃ* 'sun, day' (j-mallory2015). A loanword connected to the Turkic sun goddess [*Gun Ana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun-Ana).

### Sun Dogs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-dog
Alternatively, Jonas Persson suggested that out of Norse mythology and archaic names — Danish: solhunde (sun dog), Norwegian: solhund (sun dog), Swedish: solvarg (sun wolf) — in the Scandinavian languages, constellations of two wolves hunting the Sun and the Moon, one after and one before, may be a possible origin for the term.
