> Dawn has lovers, both mortal and immortal.

- On Tragedy of dawn's love: "If there is no Indian Tithonos, growing ever older in the house of his perpetually young consort, there is at least an awareness of the tragic contrast between her and us. ‘Bringing old age, thou hast come, O unageing Dawn . . . Unageing, thou dost make to age all else’ ([[ts4.3.11.5]]; cf. [[rv1.124.2]]).
