- [[samos]]and [[giamos]] "And so Samos and Giamos, at least to me, emanate from cosmic Fire and cosmic Waters, Truth and the Void, the Two Powers as used in ADF, an extrapolation of Order and Chaos as seen in Indo-European polytheisms.""....All throughout Indo-European sources, there are several instantiations of fire and water, but in the myths of IE cultures that have come to us, there are overarching principles which are pillars to our worldview. Strabo’s quote and theories on Samos and Giamos show us that the Indo-European ‘Two Powers”, as we call them, extends into the worldview of the Celts...We work with these Two Powers as currents from the sky and from earth, we recognize them within us by using visualizations which make one feel connected with sky and earth. As we perform these visualizations, over time, we begin to develop real feelings when they mix and release the third power, the mists of making.
