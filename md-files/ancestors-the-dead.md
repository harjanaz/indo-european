## Estonia
Communication with the dead occurred through ritual meals on the graves which took place at funerals, certain anniversaries after the death and on holidays….These cemetery feasts are not connected with puritanical mourning and commemoration: a positive holiday spirit and even merriment predominate…In Estonian tradition the ancestors were also believed to visit their homes at Souls' Visiting Time between September and December: then the souls were given food and sauna was heated for them (Hiiemäe 1995). It was possible to meet the dead either as home wanderers or in the form of insects or small animals - mothers, bees, butterflies, flies, birds or frogs. The deceased may appear in dreams, predict the future and can even influence the life of the living. These beliefs have a common background: the dead are not dead in the real sense but continue their life in the other world, open for contacts under certain circumstances. The ancient concept of the cemetery differs from the modern one: it is not only a site for remembering or commemorating the dead but, first and foremost, their dwelling site and a place where communication is possible. Such ideas applied to not only the local village cemeteries but also the central Christian burial grounds.
