## Look Into
- #lookinto: It seems the [[ancestors-the-dead]] refered exclusivly to those related by blood to IE cultural practioners, and not to all the dead in the world. Where did they think non-IE ancestors resided? The IE underworld? or their own underworlds?. This gets into the broader questions and issues of ancient [[interpretatio]] and cultural contact.
