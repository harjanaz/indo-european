## Extract
> I have one small point of reservation. It seems debatable that there was an Indo-European epic literature — a lost Indo-European epic or epics — that was ancestral to the classical epics of India and Greece, as Ms. Smith claims time and again (e.g., page 106). Instead, typological similarities seem to be involved: ancient Near Eastern (Sumerian and Semitic) and modern Central Asian (Turkic and Mongolian) epics feature similar qualities. Would it not be time for Indology to join the mainstream of comparatist research?
