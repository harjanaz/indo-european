## Just send me your notes!

`indo-european.wiki (at) outlook.com`

Email them, I'll incorpoate them, and put your name/alias on the contributor list. They could be whole folders of notes, or just a single correction for a page.
 
## File Format
.doc .pdf .txt are fine,  but I would prefer markdown (i.e. `filename.md`) and that you use double bracket internal links (ex. `[[filename]]`) instead of regular markdown links (ex. `[link](filename)`).  I reccomend using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to create your notes.


## Zoom/Phone/Etc
I'm open to Zoom meetings and phone calls, just email me.
