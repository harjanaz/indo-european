> Then said Gangleri: "What tidings are to be told concerning the Weird of the Gods? Never before have I heard aught said of this." Hárr answered: "Great tidings are to be told of it, and much. The first is this, that there shall come that winter which is called the Awful Winter: in that time snow shall drive from all quarters; frosts shall be great then, and winds sharp; there shall be no virtue in the sun. Those winters shall proceed three in succession, and no summer between; but first shall come three other winters, such that over all the world there shall be mighty battles. In that time brothers shall slay each other for greed's sake, and none shall spare father or son in manslaughter and in incest; so it says in Völuspá:
> Brothers shall strive | and slaughter each other;  
> Own sisters' children | shall sin together;  
> Ill days among men, | many a whoredom:  
> An axe-age, a sword-age, | shields shall be cloven;  
> A wind-age, a wolf-age, | ere the world totters.
