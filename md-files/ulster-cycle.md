# Ulster Cycle
	 
o "[It] concerns the activities of the Ulaid or Ulstermen, particularly their great conflict with the neighboring province of Connacht, and the exploits of their hero Cú Chulainn."
o "The great war between Ulster and Connacht is brought about largely by Medb's jealousy of Ailill, whose great bull she covets."
o "The combat of bulls symbolizes the struggle between Ulster and Connacht: their death signals peace following the Pyrrhic victory of the Ulstermen."
	· "The hero Ferghus comments that the two animals were sent purposely to Ireland by jealous gods...[and] how the bulls are enchanted, metamorphosed creatures, who were originally swineherds and then took a succession of different forms, but had always been a source of strife and destruction. "
