# `*H₂eryo-men`
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_mythology#Welfare_god)
## Etymology
- It derives from the noun `*h₂eryos` (a "member of one's own group", "one who belongs to the community", in contrast to an outsider), also at the origin of the Indo-Iranian `*árya`, "noble, hospitable", and the Celtic `*aryo-`, "free man" (Old Irish: aire, "noble, chief"; Gaulish: arios, "free man, lord"). 
## Associations
- welfare and the community
- the building and maintenance of roads/pathways
- healing
- the institution of marriage

## Branches 
- [[pii-aryaman]]
	- The Vedic god Aryaman is frequently mentioned in the Vedas, and associated with social and marital ties. 
	- In the Gāthās, the Iranian god Airyaman seems to denote the wider tribal network or alliance, and is invoked in a prayer against illness, magic, and evil. 
 
 - Celtic
	 - In the mythical stories of the founding of the Irish nation, the hero Érimón became the first king of the Milesians (the mythical name of the Irish) after he helped conquer the island from the Tuatha Dé Danann. He also provided wives to the Cruithnig (the mythical Celtic Britons or Picts), a reflex of the marital functions of `*h₂eryo-men`. The Gaulish given name Ariomanus, possibly translated as "lord-spirited" and generally borne by Germanic chiefs, is also to be mentioned.
