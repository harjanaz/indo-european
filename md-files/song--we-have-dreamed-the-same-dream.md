## Lyrics
> Sky Fathers we call you
Our eyes open to see
The light burning forward
As we gather to dream.
It's our sacred devotion
To a future we seek.
Lived with inner eye open
The stars gather between
Let us dream
<br>
I see wheatfields and rainbows
Easy smiles around the scene
We are riding the cosmos
We have the dreamed the same dream
There are pillars of honor
Faith flows like a stream
Upon mountains of valor
We have dreamed the same dream
Let us dream
<br>
Those who have come before us
Those who are yet to be
Put their trust in the people
Who have dreamed the same dream
Through this dream we're united
Through one mind we have seen
A new imperium rises
We have dreamed the same dream
