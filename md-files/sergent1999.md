> According to [comparative mythologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative-mythology "Comparative mythology") [Bernard Sergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard-Sergent "Bernard Sergent"), the Lithuanian myth of [Eglė the Queen of Serpents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egl%C4%97-the-Queen-of-Serpents "Eglė the Queen of Serpents") shares similar motifs with stories found among Native American peoples ([Wayampi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayampi "Wayampi"), [Yahgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaghan-people "Yaghan people") and [Coos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coos-people "Coos people")), which may be explained by an inherited Ancient North Eurasian motif featuring a woman marrying an aquatic animal, violating human laws on [exogamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogamy "Exogamy") and connecting the terrestrial and aquatic worlds. Sergent reminds however that the precise time and place of origin of the myth cannot be settled with certainty.
