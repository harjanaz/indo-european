## Explaination

*Divine Refraction* - the development of forms of an ur-god across space and time, both _between_ branches (i.e. ‘Inter-‘) and _within_ each branch ('Intra-‘).
- **Inter-** | Zeus, Jupiter, Odin, and Dyaus Pitar are all refractions of the PIE *Dyḗus ph₂tḗr
- **Intra-** Hárr, Jafnhárr, and Þriði were all refractions of Odin
	- This form of the process was know to the Norse, see [[grimnismal]]XLVIII and [[gylfaginning]]XX . In the later Hárr attributes the man names of Odin to (1) migrations of early peoples and their development of distinct languages, and (2) to the literal wandering of the god Odin.
