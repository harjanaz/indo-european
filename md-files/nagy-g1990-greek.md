## Summary
> [[nagy-g2015-07-22]]ยง30: "...One fine day, I hope to revisit a detailed study I undertook many years ago concerning the common linguistic heritage shared by the Hittite and the Greek languages in referring to practices of cremation. The main objects of study were (1) archived prescriptions concerning the funerals of Hittite kings and (2) narrated descriptions concerning the funeral of the hero Patroklos in [[iliad]]23. In that study, I concentrated on **the shared Indo-European linguistic heritage of Hittite and Greek funerary traditions**.
