Unlike in the Greco-Roman world, where the halo was forgoten [except christianity], in Iran it developed into the *khvarenah*, an important concept in Mazdaic theology.

#### Etymology

(Av.  ***xᵛarənah***) corresponds to (OInd. ****svarṇas-*** '*sunshine*'). Both are derived from the name of the sun. 

#### Def

Usually a radiance around the head of a man in possesion of it.

In Avestan culture this light was a gift from God granted to his most eminent believers. It represents a presage that they will achieve victory and prosperity. In the Gathas (Y.51.18) noble neophytes recieve ***xᵛarənah*** and (***xšaθra-*** 'imperium') when they convert, in other words, promise and fulfillment.  [Mithra](mithra.md) had the epithets "giver of ***xᵛarənah***" and "giver of ***xšaθra-***" (Yt.10.16).

#### Sasan

- "Pāpak dreamt that a sun was shining from Sasan's head; in both cases [refering to the Roman case of Servius Tullius] this light is both presage and guaranty of a kingly destiny it is the 'royal *xvarenah*'."

#### Yima

- In Yt.19 the story of Yima is told, who, having done great deeds, thought he was a god and wanted to be adorned; but "when he had this false and deceitful thought, the ***xᵛarənah*** was seen to fly away from him in a bird's form". This matches perfect with the Irish ***én gaile*** 'battle-rage bird' form of [Lúan Láith](luan-laith.md).
