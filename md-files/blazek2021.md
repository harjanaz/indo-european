## Abstract
> A purpose of the present contribution is to summarize and compare in a typological perspective the most characteristic migrational motifs reflected in the later literary sources. Specifically, I will examine the Balkan origin of Phryges according to Herodotus [6.45.1; 7.73.1] and Strabo [12.8.3] and that of Messapians by Pliny [3.16/102]; the migration of the Celts from the Gaul to Northern Italy described by Titus Livius [5.33-34]; mythical migrational waves to Ireland depicted in *Lébor Gabala*; mythical migrations of the Goths by Jordanes: *De origine actibusque Getarum* or *Getica* [§79–81]; migration to and from the island of Gotland by *Gutasaga* (Chapter 1); West Germanic invasion to Britain by Bede Venerabilis: *Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum* [I, 14-15]; migration of the Langobards by *Origo gentium Langobardum* [1-7], etc.
