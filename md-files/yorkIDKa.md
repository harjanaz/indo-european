A wider investigation into various paganisms – classical, indigenous, Indo-European, etc. – suggests that the more ‘universal’ understanding for the cultures of the northern hemisphere would place the earth in the south and ﬁre as the rising sun in the east. This particular element-direction linking is one that comprises the practice of Prudence Jones or the tradition of Patrick McCollum among others."
