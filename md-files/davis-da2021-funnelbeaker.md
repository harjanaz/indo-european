## Description
> European farmers reached the southern edge of the North European Plain, not far south of the Baltic coast, before 5000 BC but didn't reach northern Germany and southern Scandinavia until 1000 years later. So for a thousand years there was some interaction with groups of the Late Mesolithic ErtebÃ¸lle Culture - a hunter gatherer people in this region during the 5th millennium BC which is shown by traded stone axes and other artefacts. Once it was thought that these northern hunter gathers gradually adopted farming over that thousand years but thanks to DNA analysis we know that's not the case.

> The Funnelbeaker culture appear in my novel *Thunderer: Gods of Bronze 2*. In the story they're called the Furun but what were the real historical people like?
