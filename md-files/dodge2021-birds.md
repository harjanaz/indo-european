## Abstract
> In this paper I aim to bring together the work of various scholars—especially Vries, Hammer, and Staal—concerning a Vedic and Indo-European (IE) tradition about birds, poetpriests, and religious chants. I will argue: (1) the Ṛgveda contains a motif-complex regarding birds, poet-priests, and hymns. (2) A parallel to one of the motifs [Mythic Motif α: “bird(s) sing(s) hymn(s), like (a) poet-priest(s)”] can be found in an Iranian text regarding the Karšift bird and his companions. (3) This commonality implies a shared Indo-Iranian heritage for this motif. (4) Another Ṛgvedic motif [Poetic Motif A: “the hymns of poet-priests sound like bird-song”] had a ritual correlate: priests singing with a high-pitched voice. (5) This same ritual vocalization style is found in the Germanic tradition of magical chants (galdr). (6) This implies a common Proto-Indo-European (PIE) inheritance for this ritual vocalization style.
