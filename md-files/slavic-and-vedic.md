# Vedic influence in Ancient Russia
Below is the picture of the Slavic God named [Kryshen](kryshen.md) playing his flute for the pleasure of his wife whose name is [Rada](rada.md). According to the Slavic tradition Kryshen journeys to the island of the Sun, described as the Greek island of Rhodes. 
There he meets the beautiful daughter of the Sun God her name being Rada. In the Vedas RadhaKrsna are known as the highest realisation of the absolute truth, they are the two complimentary aspects of the one absolute truth. 
This is not the first time the island of Rhodes has been assosciated with the name of Radha, some suggesting her to be the source of its name. The story continues that after successfully satisfying the demands of her father, Kryshen wins the hand of his daughter. Kryshen is also known as the shepherd, the protector of cows and bulls, which is obviously Gopal Krsna the lover of the cows.

The Sanskrit “bhaga” and “bhagavan” are names which describe God, the supreme being. In the Slavic languages it becomes “bog” as seen in the names of their Gods "Ognebog" "Stribog" "Dazbog" "Belbog" all with the suffix "bog" meaning “God". Dazbog is a Slavic solar deity whose name is formed from two Sanskrit words "dadati" meaning "to give" "gift" and also "bhaga" meaning "God". The same name is seen in the country of Iraq where we find its capital "Bhagdad" meaning "the gift ( dadati ) of God ( bhaga )" which is simply "Dazbog" in reverse. We find the exact same meaning in the popular Slavic name “Bogdanovich” its meaning being “gift of God”, the “bog” is related to the Sanskrit “bhaga” meaning “God” the “dano” being the Sanskrit “dana” meaning “gift” and the “vich” simply means “son of”.

Ognebog is the Slavic God of fire whose linguistic and cultural source reflects the Vedic God of fire "Agni". Stribog is known as the "God of the wind" he is in charge of winds and hurricanes and appears as the mystical bird "stratim". His name may be related to the Sanskrit "str" which means "scattered" "strewn" "spread" its a Sanskrit root which gives us the words "star" and "astral”.

The Slavic "Yndra" is the thunder God, a hero who battles to protect Svarga loka ( heaven ) and a personality who controls the rain. In the Vedas we have Indra the God of thunder, the God of rain and the King of heaven. It is futile to debate if "Yndra" the God of rain is related to "Indra" the God of rain, they obviously are. The Slavic Goddess of death is known as "Morana" in the Vedas we have "Mara" the God of death and we have "marana" meaning "death" showing how the two cultures are one. Described as a divine force of nature "Maya" is a Slavic Goddess who bears the gifts of mother earth. In the Vedas "Maya" is the regulatrix of this world, the universal mother upon which everything rests, both "Mayas" are synonymous concepts emanating from a shared culture.

"Since the Renaissance there has been no event of such worldwide significance in the history of culture as the discovery of Sanskrit literature in the latter part of the eighteenth century.” - The renowned British Sanskrit scholar Arthur Anthony Macdonell (1854-1930)

“Makosh” is the Slavic Goddess of destiny, in Eastern Europe villages were named after her and archeological evidence dates her as far back as 700B.C. The river “Mokos” flows through the region of Prekmurje. in Slovenia we have the village of “Makose”, in Croatia the village of “Makosica”, near Dubrovnik the village of “Makose” and also the suburb of “Stara Makosica”. A village near Zagreb is called “Mokos”, we have the hill known as “Mukusina” in Bosnia and south of Mostar lies the hill known as “Mukosa” all of which reflect the Goddess “Makosh”.

“Makosh” is a Sanskrit cognate formed from two Sanskrit words “matr” meaning “mother” and “kosa” meaning “treasury” “repository” “provisions”. Makosh holds the horn of plenty and provides for those who are righteous, hence we can see how the Sanskrit meanings reflect her nature as “the mother of destiny”.
~
Makosh has two daughters named “Dolya” and “Nedolya” who are known respectively as “fate" and “doom”. "Dolya" is said to haunt you if you make the wrong choice, her name is from the Sanskrit "dola" meaning "oscillating" and "swinging" and "doloya" which means "doubtful" "uncertain". "Nedolya" is simply the Sanskrit prefix "na" meaning "none" as in "no dolya" "no fate" "no fortune”. It is possible that the three Goddesses are one forming a triad which is common amongst the Goddesses of the ancient wisdom traditions.

"The oldest actual contact, as the Zagreb linguist Radoslav Katicic has pointed out in a recent colloquy dedicated to Indo-Yugoslav relations, is to be found in the primeval religion of the Slavs, which was by origin Indian, partly through Persian intermediation. However, this fact, proved by the analysis of the expressions for deities, is common to all the Slavonic peoples.".
