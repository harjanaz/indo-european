> The ancient goddess, born again and again, dressed in the same color, causes the mortal to age and wears away his life-span, as a cunning gambler carries off the stakes

> Being born again and again though ancient, (always) beautifying herself to the same hue, like a successful (gambler) with the best throw who diminishes the stake (of his opponent), the goddess keeps diminishing the lifetime of the mortal as she ages him.
