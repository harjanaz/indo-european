General:  "Moral interpretations of myths" was a tactics used by pagans in reaction to the contemporary moral focus of the society caused by Christianity "For many who wished to keep the religion of their fathers it offered a means of giving that religion new life and of bringing it into line with the modern conscience." (p. 87) [There's no evidence for it before hand I suppose?] Christian apologists held this against the pagans, but once they had taken control they use it themselves.
 
"Do you honestly believe that Homer...had in mind the allegories which have been foisted off on him by Plutarch, Heraclides, Ponticus, Eustathius, and Phornutus, and which Politian has purloined from them? If you do believe this, you are far indeed from my opinion, which is that Homer could no more have dreamed of anything of the sort than Ovid in his Metamorphoses could have been thinking of the gospel[s]." (Rabelais p.95)
 
About the Porta Maggiore in Rome: "Carcopino has shown that the decoration as a whole embodies the great esoteric doctrines associated with the Pythagorean sects...the Basilica of Constantine was mistaken for a temple of Bacchus!" (p.105)
