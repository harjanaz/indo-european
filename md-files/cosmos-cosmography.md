Existence as it is explained by [[religion]].


The cosmos has a structure (a cosmography) and a narrative of creation (cosmogony). All of this is cosmology.

The cosmos has a structure ([[space]]). It contains objects (ex. sun, moon, etc) and [[beings]]. These beings can be subject to [[time]] (or eternal), and can be abstract personifications of things, even physical things. For instance, there is a feminine being that is sometimes linked with the acis mundi and trans-functinonal social order. 


## Tripartite View
[[worlds]]
[[time]] cosmogony, cycles, life/death,

This page is for the cosmos of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. It's a complex topic with multiple aspects. For example, each world has a corresponding sky, time, and deity. But it generally follows a tripartite formation:

```
World	Sky		Time				Deity			Function  Beings

Upper	Bright	Day (diurnal)		Sky Father		1         Gods
Middle	Red		Dawn/Dusk (liminal)	Dawn Goddess	2         Mortals
Lower	Dark	Night (nocturnal)	Night Sky God	3         Ancestors
```


-  [[time-of-day]]
- [[space]] worlds, cosmography, beings, etc
- Deity: [[sky-gods]]
- [[functions]]
- [[sky-color]]

The [[world-1]] is associated with the [[bright-sky]] (dinural) [[daytime]], [[day-sky-father]], and [[first-function-sovereignty]].

The middle [[buck-1.21-earth-land]] is associated with the [[red-sky]], liminal periods of [[dawn]] & [[dusk]], and the [[second-function]].

The lower world is associated with the [[dark-sky]] noctural [[night]], [[night-sky-father]], and the [[third-function]].

So far we've talked about time only insofar as "time-of-day". But if we bright human mortality into the picture: our [[life]]time is associated with the middle world. The [[otherworld]] is linked to both the upper and lower worlds, and has both bright and dark forms.
