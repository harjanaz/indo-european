## Description
Research has discovered words that were around before the Proto-Indo Europeans, some of which make sense, but some are strange. Discovering old language is challenging, and when they are more than 9,000 years old methods such as predicting cognate evolution become unreliable. Following a study called "Ultra Conserved words point to a deep language ancestry across Eurasia" researchers have tried to discover if there was a language that is the ancestor to proto Indo European, and in doing so discovered a few interesting findings about language along the way. I also suggest an observation which could affect the creation myth of the Indo Europeans based on these.
