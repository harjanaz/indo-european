related to [[fate]], [[fate-impersonal]]



I'm not sure if "impersonal" is a good word. Our modern world is impersonal, but the PIE wasn't. Fate is always connected to beings. BUT if cosmic order is seen as balance which is then "restored", restoration is not necessarily personal, it's not like retribution.


Indic [[dharma]]
[[orlog]]
[[rta]]

A legalistic view of cosmic-order: divine retribution (from tresspassing divine law) brings justice and vengeance. (These pages redirect to here: [[divine-law]], [[divine-order]], [[divine-retribution]]). Is this "personal" or "impersonal"? Well, law is impersonal. But, in so far as it is related to a ruler, or founding figure, it can be personal. Justice has easily become revenge. 

How are the following related?

fate / dharma / order
law / justice
retribution / revenge / vengeance


Then, there is "order" as system, and "order" as an ORDER from a godhead.
