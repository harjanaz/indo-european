## Abstract
> Since the direct heir of the Indo-European Dawn-goddess, Austra, is only attested a few times in a mythological context in the Latvian folk songs, it is another Latvian goddess, Māra, who deserves our attention if we want to find surviving inherited Indo-European poetic formulae characteristic of the Dawn. Her relation to gold, to Heaven’s doors, to reddish cows and to the morning leaves little, if any, doubt that Māra is indeed the Latvian Dawn-goddess, beside Austra.
