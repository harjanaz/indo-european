# Lleu Llaw Gyffes

Â· "Lleu is probably an ancient British god, perhaps cognate with the Irish Lugh with whom he shares a name associated with light. His birth, destiny and immortality imply his divine status, as does the care taken to protect him by the magician Gwydion. The deception, riddle and contradiction which underpin "Math" are all devices common to myth and may be found equally in the Irish tradition and in stories of the Graeco-Roman pantheon."
