## Abstract

This article suggests that we can possibly reach a fuller understanding of the IndoEuropean pantheon by positing a prehistoric state when a tenfold set of gods had places in a structure of space and time and social organisation. The place of kingship is especially complex but it is suggested that eight of the deities (including two goddesses) can be categorised in terms of three pairs of dualities.
