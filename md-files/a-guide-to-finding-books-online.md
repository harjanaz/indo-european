## 1. Libgen
By far the best site to search for pdfs/ebooks is Library Genesis. Here's a Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis)  on Libgen. There are various urls you can use to get there, including: [libgen.li](https://libgen.li/)

The download links are under "Mirrors" on the left. These mirrors link to various other websites that actually host the files, like [z-lib.org](https://z-lib.org/)

## 2. archive.org
Another great source is [archive.org](https://archive.org)
The best way to search the site is NOT by searching the site itself, but by doing a google search with "arhcive.org" included. For example, you could search google for: `dumezil archive.org`

## 3. Other
- [scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/) just get a free account
- If you're not in academia, just go to your nearest college library and their wifi should allow you to access and download from  sites like jstor.org and hathitrust.org for free.
