- PIE `gu̯i̯eh3-` "live" 
- PIE tek̑- & g̑enh1- [249] "engender, give birth"
- PIE `mer-` and `nek̑ -` [109]"die" 
- PIE `mr̥to-` "mortal"
- PIE `*n̥k̑-u̯o-`
- PIE `*dʰg̑ʰm-on-` "earth(ling)"


- Speakers of IE languages viewed themselves as mortal and terrestrial as opposed to the immortal heavenly gods, hence we find terms for human beings like:
	- PIE mr̥to- "mortal" (from mer- "die" [109])
	- PIE dhg̑hom-i̯o-/-on- "earthling" (from PIE dheg̑ hom- ‘earth’ [159]). The same idea is expressed in the Homeric phrase Il. 5.442 *athanátōn te theõn khamaì erkhoménōn t’ anthrṓpōn* "of the immortal gods and of men who walk on earth". Correspondingly, the gods were the *n̥-mr̥tōs "immortal ones" (Grk. ámbrotoi, Lat. dī immortales, etc.).

## Old Age
- The terms for old man and old woman in PIE (g̑ erh2 -ont- [276], g̑ erh2 -u- ‘old woman’ [277]) are derived from the verbal root g̑erh2- ‘rub, grind, make old’ [252]. "The worn down ones".
