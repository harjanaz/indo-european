## Speculation
- The lion/tiger thing might have been a southern/middle eastern influence, perhaps the norse wild-cats were closer to the original. But this is a REFLEX not a reconstruction, meaning it has more to do with the patterns of how the branches developed the original idea than with a single oiginal idea.

## Modern
- Iceland's national personification, [The Lady of the Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_of_the_Mountain) *Fjallkonan*--more than Sweden's Mother Svea and Britian's Britannia--happens to resemble this Mountain Queen reflex.
- India's Bharat Mata. Unlike the european personaifications, she is a literal deity. "wherein the ‘National Personifications’ have been hastily (re-)constructed following quite substantial periods of ‘nothing’ – ; Bharat Mata is very much a ‘continuation’ of a long tradition of Durga and Her Aspects being regarded in this role of national patrons and protectors." ([[rolinson2018-08-15]])

## Mountain Queen *as* Mountain and *as* Nation
> "One final thought, though: for the devoted man in a relationship, and more especially for the ‘family man’ at all times, anyway – these female figures can very easily become the center of our lives. Indeed, it is not at all coincidental that we can find mythic ‘inferences’ for same – in cultures where the Axis Mundi of the universe (or of the Realm) is a Mountain (such as Olympus or Meru), we see these female deities identified with, and as, Mountains. In Nordic culture, meanwhile, leaving aside the no doubt fascinating discursion I could write-up on the coterminous (arguable) origins of both Freyja/Frigg, various ‘mountainous’ terms, and also particularly *coniferous* trees [for the moment, the visual and slight phonetic similarity of the Fir Tree will have to do…], we should therefore find it absolutely unsurprising that the religion of the “World Tree” has numerous attestations for the Goddess in question *as* a “tree”. In fact, I suppose you might say – with the often (deliberately) VERY hazy distinction between (the) ‘Earth’ and ‘Earth Mother’ (seriously – it’s literally the same word, Bhumi, in Sanskrit; a similar case can be made, if I recall, for “Jord” in Old Norse) , that these women can become “our whole world” (in a rather literal sense, come to think of it, as applies those aforementioned ‘Earth Mother’ archetypes). And as relates to the Nation, a similar dynamic of course presents itself." <button>[[rolinson2018-08-15]]</button>
