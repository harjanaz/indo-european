## Abstract
> Disregarding to a certain extent the framework provided by this volume’s title, the present paper ventures to introduce some terms and categories on a broader scope in order to approach two rather scattered and mysterious narratives each focussing on one major type of breach of law: theft in the case of the Loki-Heimdallr-Brísingamen myth, and extremely grievous bodily harm as far as Fenrir and T ý r are concerned. Aiming at a reading as lucid and compelling as possible in terms of methodology, I will draw on selected aspects of various theories of violence, power and force.
