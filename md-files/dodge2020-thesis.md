## Abstract
> In 1982, in an article titled “Waters of Memory, Waters of Forgetfulness”, the Indo-Europeanist Bruce Lincoln reconstructed the following Proto-Indo-European (henceforth PIE) narrative from Platonic (Republic, 614B - 621D), Orphic (Gold Tablets), Indic (Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 1.4), Nordic (Gylfaginning 4, 15; Grímnismál 28; Vǫluspá 28); and Celtic (Feis Tighe Chonáin) written sources. See Table I in Lincoln’s article for a summary.

> "On the way to the otherworld, souls of the dead had to cross a river, the waters of which washed away all of their memories. These memories were not destroyed, however, but were carried by the river's water to a spring, where they bubbled up and were drunk by certain highly favored individuals, who became inspired and infused with supernatural wisdom as a result of the drink."

>   
> Lincoln briefly traced the development of this proto-narrative in the various Indo- European (henceforth IE) branches. See Table II “Transformations” in Lincoln’s article for a summary. While Lincoln’s article was foundational, it was also only a preliminary sketch. In light of this, we will build on his work and refine his reconstruction by gathering additional Graeco- Roman, Indo-Iranian, Germanic, Celtic, and Hittite sources. Additionally, once we have established the PIE background, we will follow this narratives’ development in the myths and cults of two IE figures: the Germanic Odin and Greek Orpheús. Lastly, we will consider possible Finno-Ugric and Laurasian connections. The ultimate goal of this thesis is to arrive at a greater understanding of the development of IE culture, from its primordial roots to its various local manifestations.
