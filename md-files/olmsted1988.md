## Abstract
> This article outlines the large corpus of common traits suggestin that Cú Chulain is the Irish correlative of Vedic Varuna, and that he developed from what Dumézil has termed the "one-eyed" IE god. In contrast, Lug developed from the IE god corresponding to Vedic Mithra. These correlations in turn suggest that much of the Ulster cycle, the *Táin* in particular, arose from older IE mythology.
