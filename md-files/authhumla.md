# Norse *Auðhumla*
- Audhumla, meaning “hornless cow,” is rich with milk. Audhumla is the primordial Cow that the Progenitor giant Ymir suckled from to survive. At this time in the area of Void, which Audhumla would theoretically have been existing ( Ginnungagap ), the four rivers of milk that flowed from the Cow could be easily considered to have floated into the known universe. Audhumla licks free the Gods from the Ice. 

## Possible Eurasian Background
> "Many years ago, I sought to interpret [Ymir](ymir.md) and Auðhumla as inherited from a broad "Indo-European tradition," but I would now be more inclined to see a more fluid [Eurasian continuum](eurasian.md)." ([[lincoln1981]]69-95, [[b-lincoln2003]]59-76)
