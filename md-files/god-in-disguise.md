[[gods]]
# God in Disguise
- Widespread
- It has to do with divine perception. 
- It has a sub form, the [[god-as-guest]], which also incorporates the notion of [[hospitality-strangers]].

#### Greece
- Gods had to disguise themselves to appear to mortals
- Gods can easily recognize other gods, but humans cannot
> [HO-13.312-313] "*It is hard, goddess, for a mere mortal to know you when he meets you even if he's very intelligent, for you take whatever shape you desire.*"

> Book 13 Odysseus fails to recognize Athena, but he did earlier. This shows how as a hero he is close to the gods, but not equal with them (when it comes to divine perception).

> [Hymn To Demeter] Demeter gets angry with Metaneira for not recognizing her. She says that it is the foolishness and ignorance of mortals that prevents them from knowing their fates.

> All of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Improper action and [[hospitality-strangers]] led to punishment (usually by being turned into a animal).
