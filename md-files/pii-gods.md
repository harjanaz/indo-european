[[pii-beings]], [[gods]]

---

The PIIs had an otiose Sky Father (`*Dyaus`) who had a large number of associates (Skt. Ādityās; Av. Aməša Spəntas). These associates were led by two sovereigns: a legal one (`*Mitra`) and a magical one (`*Varuna`). These two sovereigns both resided in the heavens, played a role in creation, and ruled over the world dispensing favors and punishments to man.

They also had the [Wise Lord](wise-lord.md) and a demiurge, [The Shaper](the-shaper.md).
