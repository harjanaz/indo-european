## Soteriology
It also has further societal and devotional implications for the ‘soteriology’ of each pathway. Insofar as the highest honour for the pious in both cultures can be regarded as the demonstration over the course of one’s lifetime and in the manner of one’s death that you, too, are worthy to join the most esteemed ranks of the retinue of the Lord of the (Un)Dead [Draugrdrottin/Bhutenath] and ascend to a more fundamental (indeed – Feudal ! ) unity of purpose with the primarch-primogenitor Heavenly Father of our people(s).
