The Ontological Turn was movement in anthropology towards ontology. See [[dodge2020-ontological]] for an overview of the movement. The theory was applied to classics by [[anderson-g]]. Here are some of his thoughts on the phases of IE and greek civilization:

> This grand narrative would no longer be a story about multiple periods in the lifetime of a single, more or less continuous world. In all likelihood, it would be a tale about a succession of at least three distinctly different worlds, all with their own particular ways of being human. It would begin with the “pre- Greek” world of those who first settled in the area of the Athenian acropolis, before the coming of the Indo-Europeans in ca. 2100 bc. It would then include the world which culminated in the formation of a near-eastern-style order in the later centuries of the second millennium bc, with its palace complex on the citadel, its centrally managed mode of life, its Indo-European gods and language, and its ruling wanax, who most probably served as some kind of intermediary between communities human and divine. And of course it would also include the later world of the Athenian polis, the world of this book, where, ultimately, the life of a unitary social body was sustained by a primordial cosmic ecology of gods, land, and people.
