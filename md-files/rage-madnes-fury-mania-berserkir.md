[[warriors-male]] | [[animal-men]]

> **At the beginning of the first sentence of the European tradition, in the first verse of the Iliad, the word "rage" occurs**. (p1) To sing of rage means to make rage noteworthy, to make it worthy of being thought (*denkwürdig*). However, what is noteworthy is in proximity to what is impressive and permanently praiseworthy--we could almost say: it is close to the Good. [...] {What we are dealing with is not the rage of Moses, who smashes the tables while people bask in front of the golden calf is not the anger of Yahweh who "bristles with anger" and destroys their persecutors.} The truth is that Homer moves within a world that is characterized by an appreciation of war without limitations. ***However dark the horizon of this universe of battles and deaths might be, the basic tone of the presentation is determined by the pride of being allowed to be a witness to such spectacles and such fates. The illuminating visibility of these spectacles and fates reconciles with the harshness of reality.*** This force [rage] elevates human beings, who are covered by a high, watchful sky.

> Just as the singer could be the mouthpiece of a singing force, the hero feels himself the arm of rage. [...] Of course, the arm to hold the sword also belongs to the singer, to whom the hero, and all his weapons, owe the immortal fame. Hence the connection of god-hero-singer constitutes the first effective media network. [[p-sloterdijk2010]]p5


> The song concerning the heroic energy of a warrior, with which the *epos* of the ancient starts out, elevates rage to the rank of a substance, out of which the world is formed. [[p-sloterdijk2010]]p6 (see more there)

> Starting with the first lines, he [Homer] emphasizes the baleful force of heroic rage: wherever it manifest itself, it unleashes its power on all sides. The Greeks themselves have to suffer even more from it than the Trojans. Already in the very beginning of the unraveling war, Achille's rage turns against his own people.[[p-sloterdijk2010]]p2
