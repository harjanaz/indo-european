## Highlights
- At least 64 mostly male canids were sacrificed at a site in the Russian steppes.
- Inversion of the non-food treatment of canids suggests a rite of passage.
- Initiatory war-bands symbolized as dogs and wolves offer Indo-European parallels.
- Comparative Indo-European mythology explains the meaning of the ritual.

## Abstract
> At the Srubnaya-culture settlement of Krasnosamarskoe in the Russian steppes, dated 1900â€“1700 BCE, a ritual occurred in which the participants consumed sacrificed dogs, primarily, and a few wolves, violating normal food practices found at other sites, during the winter. At least 64 winter-killed canids, 19% MNI/37% NISP, were roasted, fileted, and apparently were eaten. More than 99% were dogs. Their heads were chopped into small standardized segments with practiced blows of an axe on multiple occasions throughout the occupation. Two adult men and two adult women from the nearby cemetery, possibly two generations of resident ritual specialists, showed unusual skeletal pathologies and post-mortem treatments. The repeated violation of the canid-eating taboo, unique to this site, combined with the metaphor of human transformation into male canids, suggests that the participants entered a liminal state typical of a rite of passage. Parallels from comparative Indo-European (IE) mythology provide the indigenous narrative that gave meaning to this ritual: we argue that it was an initiation into the widely attested IE institution of the youthful male war-band, symbolized by transformation into a dog or wolf.
