## 1. Libgen
The best site to search for pdfs/ebooks is ***Library Genesis*** (Libgen). Here's a Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis)  on it. There are various urls you can use to get there, for example: [libgen.li](https://libgen.li/)

The download links are under "Mirrors" on the right. These link to various other websites where you can get the files. Most of the time the files can be downloaded directly. Sometimes they are Torrents, in which case you'll need a VPN (ex. Mullvad) and a manager (ex. Transmission). Othertimes the files are only available via Tor, so you'll need to download the Tor browser (made by the same people who make Firefox). But that is very rare, most of the time you can just download directly. Tip: if you use Z-Library, they limit your number of downloads a day. BUT if you use a VPN (like Mulvlvad), you can just change your location ever time you hit the limit, and get infinite downloads that way.


## 2. archive.org
Another great dircet download site is [archive.org](https://archive.org)
The best way to search the site is NOT by searching the site itself, but by doing a google search with "arhcive.org" included. For example, you could search google for: `dumezil archive.org`

## [sciarium.com](https://sciarium.com)
- A "tit for tat" community of academics sharing pdfs they've scanned

## 4. Other
- [scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/) get a free account or skip that and just use [downscribd.com](https://downscribd.com/)

## Library WiFi for JSTOR
- If you're not in academia, just go to your nearest college library and their wifi should allow you to access and download from  sites like jstor.org and hathitrust.org for free (since the library has a subscription).
- Besides the individual library's catalog, a great website for finding books near you is [worldcat.org](https://www.worldcat.org)
