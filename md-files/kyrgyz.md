- In the tenth-century Persian text *[Hudud al-'alam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudud-al-'alam)*, the Kyrgyz was still described as a people who "venerate the Fire and burn the dead"

- Many ancient indigenous beliefs and practices, including [shamanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism) and [totemism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totemism), coexisted syncretically with Islam. Shamans, most of whom are women, still play a prominent role at funerals, memorials, and other ceremonies and rituals. This split between the northern and southern Kyrgyz in their religious adherence to Muslim practices can still be seen today. Likewise, the Sufi order of Islam has been one of the most active Muslim groups in Kyrgyzstan for over a century.
