- "[The Finno-Ugric] system of gods, which is not as strictly hierarchical as that in IE mythology -- a distinction perhaps reflecting the different structures of society prevalent among IEs and Finno-Ugric peoples." (m-hoppal2000p76)
- [[omniscience]]
- The gods do not have the attributes of omniscience, omnipotence and omnipresence, which lead to the ultimately unresolvable ‘Problem of Evil’. They are finite, limited beings, although perhaps somewhat larger than life characters. They must use their wit and wile in order to achieve their ends by means that do not constitute intrinsically virtuous actions. Ex. [[ts4.2.1.1-2]]
- NOTE BRIGHT Sky: Grk. Uranus, Hittite Uarsa, Vedic Varsa/Varesta (=Varuna? & Mitra-Varuna?), He impregnates mother earth (gaia).
