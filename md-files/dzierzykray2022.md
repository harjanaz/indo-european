## Abstract
> The pre-Slavic Kashubian-speaking peoples of the Peninsula of Hel, in northern Poland, show a physiological similarity to the peoples of southern Sweden, and although ardent members of the Catholic church still practice rituals on All Souls' Day the origins of which can be traced back to pre-Christian times when dead ancestors were remembered by candle rituals widely throughout the Indo-European world.
