## The Head of Urien / Urien’s Head

My below literal version is based on the Clancy, Ford, & Williams translations:

I carry/bear, at/by my side, a head. It’s owner was Proud Cynfarch’s son. He had once charged between two (enemy) war-bands.

I carry/bear, at/by my side, a head. The head of generous/kind Urien, who ruled/led a/the host. And there’s a black raven/crow on his white breast/chest.

I carry/bear, in my kirtle/shirt, a head. The head of generous/kind Urien, he/who ruled a/the court. And on his white breast, ravens/crows banquet/ravage-him.

I carry/bear, in my hand, a head. He was once the shepherd of/in Erchwydd/Yrechwydd. He had the noble breast/heart of a king, he was a breaker/spender of spears.

I carry/bear, next-to/at my thigh, a head. He was once the shield of/on/to-this the land, and a charger/wheel in battle. He was a pillar/prop of battle/war, and the enemies/foe’s snare. 

I carry/bear, at my left side, a head. It would be better for him to be alive, than to be in the grave. He was the haven/refuge of old men.

I carry/bear, from the land/hillside of Pennog, a head. Far-reaching/scattered are/were his war hosts(-ings). It is the head of Urien, eloquent/lavish with praise, and renowned.

I carry/bear on my shield/shoulder a head. Shame/dishonor did not come-to/embrace me. Woe to my hand for striking my lord//Ah my hand, slashed is my lord. “The sense that “although there is no shame in what i did, alas that I had to do it.” The speaker has cut off the head of his slain lord to prevent the enemy from dishonoring it. 

I carry/bear, on my arm, a head. He made a burden of biers out of the Bernicians after battle. // He furnished for Brennych’s land after battle-cry, burned biers.

I carry/bear a head in the hard grip of My hand a /generous kind lord who ruled the land. The comander/head of the pillar/column of Britain has been snatched away.
