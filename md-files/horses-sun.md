[[horses]] + [[sun]]

  - "Horses were closely linked to the solar cult. They were envisaged as animals of sufficient speed and prestige to carry the sky-god into battle...In many Indo-European sun myths, the solar disc was perceived as being carried across the sky in a chariot pulled by a horse-team. The chariot of the Greek god Apollo was the prototype for the reverse of many Celtic coins: Celtic artistry frequently reduced the image to a single horse, a chariot-wheel and a great spoked solar disc in the sky.
