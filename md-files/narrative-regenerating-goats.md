- [[manannan]] § "He was also a magician (like his welsh cognate Manawydan) and he provided help for the Tuatha Dé in their battles, including a boat which obeyed the thoughts of its sailor; a horse which travelled equally happily on sea and land; and a sword, Fragarach ('Answerer'), which could penetrate any armor. [His] magic pigs were symbols of regeneration: they could be killed and eaten on day and alive again the next, ready to be slaughtered for feasting." ~~~THOR'S GOATS [[green-mi1990]]
