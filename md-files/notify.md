A project you might find useful: indo-european.wiki

Dr. *NAME*

I maintain a website you might find useful: [indo-european.wiki](http://indo-european.wiki/). It aims to be a hyper-interlinked bibliography for Indo-European Studies. I began working on it when one of my professors at the University of Houston, Casey Dué Hackney, introduced me to IE studies. I’ve been working on it ever since, and it has grown to include more than 7000 pages, include a page on you: <indo-european.wiki/*NAME*>.
You can learn more about the site on the page [indo-european.wiki/about](http://indo-european.wiki/about) and more about me on the page [indo-european.wiki/dodge](http://indo-european.wiki/dodge). 


Please let me know if you would like me to add anything, or if have any questions. I’m open to talking over zoom if you do. The best way to reach me is the following email: `indo-european.wiki@outlook.com`

Respectfully,

_Erick Dodge_
