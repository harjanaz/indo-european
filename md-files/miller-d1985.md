## Abstract
> The type of Second Function warrior called the "Blackened Hero" is here extended to identify types of the warrior-hero in which the characteristic of trickery, intelligence and possibly magic balance the normative stances of the latter though sometimes reduced to a comic or didactic role. The trickster type, however, may also abandon its complementarity to the "true" hero and become actively opposed, as occurs, for example, in some sagas.
