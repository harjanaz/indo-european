## Description
> Figures wearing horned helmets are depicted in Scandinavian rock art, on stelae in the Iberian Peninsula, and menhirs on Corsica. And horned helmets feature on statuettes from Zealand, Sardinia, and Cyprus, on wall decorations of the Sea People on reliefs in Egypt before the Bronze Age collapse, and on the Mycenaean Warrior Vase. Clearly, horned helmets were widely distributed during this period of the Bronze Age. But why? What do they mean? And are they connected in some way? In this video we’re taking an epic voyage through the European Bronze Age in the 12th century BC from Scandinavia to the Iberian Peninsula and across the Mediterranean to the east in search of the horned helmets of traders, warriors, kings, and gods.
