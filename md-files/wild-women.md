> "This is a pretty good place to start with sketching out Freyja’s place within the constellation of the Indo-European [Mountain Queen](mountain-queen.md) as a figure of Sovereignty (of Freedom, one might potentially note – for such is at least one dimension of the notion of Sovereignty in the first place; and yes, there are, now that I think about it, an array of Devi epithets in Sanskrit which would similarly support this notion of ‘Unfettered’ – which would also connect in, potentially, to the ‘Wild” element common to so many Indo-European Goddesses, not least of which in relation to the occasional demands of Their Menfolk; and, further, a line from the Lokasenna delivered by Tyr affixing this female ‘unfettering’ characteristic to Freyr and therefore Freyja via the equivalency of the divine twins); and, from there, as an effective ’embodiment’ of the Ethnos – the tribe, the people, the Nation."[[rolinson2018-08-15]])
