Various works have been dedicated by one Indo-Europeanist to another.  

- One particularly touching one is [[arbeitman]]'s dedication to [[kerns]] in {[[arbeitman-bomhard1981]]ix-xi}. It even includes a photo of them together: Kerns white-haired and stoic, and Arbeitman long-haired and smoking a cigarette.
