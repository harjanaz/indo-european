> "Indo-European societies had, and still have, a strong proclivity for the magic number three. [...] Over against the magic number three, seen trivially in our frequent enumeration of three items (every Tom, Dick, and Harry; bell, book, and candle; man, woman, and child; noun, verb, object; and so on) is the Indo-European belief in conflict and competition, which posits a duality of combatantsâ€”man against nature, men and women, master and slave, two by two. Christian theology incorporates both structures." ([[kehoe2012]]p12)
