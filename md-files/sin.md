## Original Sin & Guilt
"The remembrance of forbidden fruit is the earliest thing in the memory of each of us...It is when we detect our own weaknesses that we come to pity or despise mankind. The human nature from which we turn away is the human nature we have discovered in the depths of our own being....however severely we may profess to judge other men, at bottom we think them better than ourselves...It is natural that society should do everything to encourage this idea." 
Henri Bergson Jewish-Catholic philosopher, from The Two Sources of Morality and Religion. This is certainly not an PIE idea.
