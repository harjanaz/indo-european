## Abstract

The potential of divisions of time to give clues to the number and identity of the Indo- European gods has not yet been fully explored and an attempt is made here to move forward the discussion of this possible additional source of information. It is assumed that the frag- mentary evidence for the Slavic gods can usefully be placed in a wider Indo-European frame- work. Recent work by Slavic scholars on divisions of time has laid an excellent foundation for further exploration.
