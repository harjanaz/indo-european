[[homeric-hymn-to-aphrodite]]

 **Summary**:
 Eos asks for eternal life for her lover Tithonos, and Zeus grants it. Unfortunately, she has forgotten to ask that he be given eternal youth, so he grows older and older, shut up in a room where he "babbles endlessly, and no more has strength at all, such as he once had in his supple limbs."
