### Family
- Sister of [Aśvins](sky-sons-indian) ([[ward-d1968]]:11). As such, because they are connected with horses, she is desribed as the color Skt. *bradhná*- "the pale red-yellow or horse coats".

### Her Importance
She is the most-invoked goddess in the Rig Veda. [[dexter1997]]:148.

### Plural word form and the Dawn Maidens
Often she is invoked in the plural [[puhvel-j1987]]:60. This could simply be a poetic way of indicating the dawns of everyday, or maybe it refers to Dawn and her Maidens [[friedrich1979]]:296. This especially clear in the Rig Veda, as in [[rv1.92.1]], “the Dawns have made their bright appearance” [[panikkar1977]].
