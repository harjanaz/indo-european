## Description
> Traditionally, to even begin studying Proto-Indo-European (PIE), one must have many years of experience with one (or multiple) ancient Indo-European (IE) languages. Yet, the dwindling number of students who meet these expectations makes teaching PIE at the undergraduate level an increasingly difficult task. This chapter proposes a unique solution: instructors should teach students a constructed language (conlang) version of PIE as a precursor to discussions on the individual surviving branches and the methodologies behind historical reconstruction. This approach was developed through the synergy of the authorsâ€™ experiences teaching a conlang version of PIE to actors for the video game Far Cry Primal, teaching PIE to undergraduate students at the University of Kentucky, and previous training in language pedagogy and transformative learning.
