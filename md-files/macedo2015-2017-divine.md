### Abstract
> In Greek religious language, there is a pattern of divine epithet use consisting in the apposition of a noun - and not an adjective - to the deity's name. A few examples: Aphrodite Psithuros 'Whisper', Demeter Homonoia 'Concord', Artemis Eupraxia 'Welfare', Athena Nike 'Victory', Zeus Keraunos 'Lightning Bolt', Apollo Koruthos 'elm'. This type of noun apposition is of Indo-European age, as is shown both by Vedic Sanskrit, where is fairly common to find words such as vrshabhá- 'bull', ketú- 'banner', ánika- 'face' in apposition to the god's name, and by Latin, e.g. Jupiter Libertas 'Liberty', Jupiter Juuentus 'Youth', Jupiter Fulmen 'Lightning'. I shall try to show that this type of concrete and abstract noun apposition may be compared to another two noun apposition types, both of them with Indo-European parallels: (i) generic appelatives such as Gk. theos, Skt. devá-, Lat. Deus 'god'; (ii) divine names used as epiclesis, e.g. Artemis Eileithyia, Zeus Ares, Aphrodite Hera, Rigvedic Agni Brhaspati, Oscan Jupiter Liber (iúveís lúvfreís). This project aims to give an exhaustive account of all Greek examples (from Mycenaean to Hellenistic Greek) and compare them with the relevant material drawn from the major Indo-European traditions (Indo-Iranian, Italic, Anatolian). In addition to this, I shall put forward a unified linguistic explanation (in semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic terms) for the three types of noun apposition under consideration, drawing upon the most recent linguistic theories on the issue.

### Abstract
> In Greek religious language there is a pattern of divine epithet use consisting in the apposition of a concrete or abstract noun – and not an adjective – to the deity’s name. A few examples: Aphrodite Ψίθυρος ‘Whisper’, Demeter Ὁμόνοια ‘Concord’, Artemis Εὐπραξία ‘Welfare’, Athena Νίκη ‘Victory’, Zeus Κεραυνός ‘Lightning Bolt’. As far as noun appositives referring to divine names are concerned, there are basically three types: (a) concrete and abstract apposed nouns; (b) generic appellatives such as θεός (this type also includes words for profession like ἰατρός, kinship terms like πατήρ, and general terms of address like ἄναξ); (c) divine names employed as epiclesis, e.g. Artemis Eileithyia, Zeus Ares, Aphrodite Hera. My aim in this talk is to provide a unified account of the different types of noun apposition in Greek religious language. To this purpose I shall first classify them according to semantic classes. Secondly, I will hint at their syntactic status in the hope of shedding light on the syntactic relationship between divine name and epithet, thus putting forward a provisional linguistic explanation, as regards both semantics and syntax, for the three types of appositives under consideration. Hitherto they have not been dealt with as a group, nor have they been adequately compared with similar examples in other Indo-European languages.
