#cleanup 

Today is an important religious observance, commemorating the triumph of an incarnate-and-born form of Deus Pater – sent from on high to help out Mankind (particularly via severance of the chains of sin upon the soul) in fulfilment of a covenant made some time beforehand with a particularly favoured scriptural figure.


Rudra & Indra
Shiva & Hanuman (Gada)
Odin & Thor

> "...Hanuman & Thor also occupy strikingly [ha] similar mythological positions – as the Friend to Man, the courageous empowerer/intervener wilfully prayed to, and a much more ‘approachable’ Figure than the oft-abjectly terrifying and downright ‘spooky’ Spear-God Odin-Rudra."

> "A situation which is somewhat mirrored, curiously enough, with the attestation for Thor as the ‘curious/unwise’ Ape, in Nordic scriptural materials."
