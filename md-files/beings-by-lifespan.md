[[beings]]

---

- Long & Immortal = [[gods]] (and [[heavenly-people]]?)
- Short & Mortal (i.e. subject to death; or more abstractly, subject to the movement of soul from middle world to upper and lower worlds as well as the decoomposition of the body. This later thing being an extension of the true cause: *ageing*, which the gods are not subject to), and thus have a dual mode (life/death): [[buck-2.1-human-being]]. I'm not sure about the afterlife, but [[buck-3-animals]] also live short lives and are subject to death.
	- Cause: [[death-beings]] & [[fate-deity]]
