It consecrates the early acts with sacred spiritual power, and must be recited gracefully. once the initial portion of the waj preceding the action has been recited, quiet has to be maintained till the waj is concluded by the recitation of the concluding portion. For example after the initial waj for breaking bread (eating) or waj for bathing is recited no other words may be pronounced, complete silence must be maintained until the concluding waj formulae is spoken after the meal/bath.
