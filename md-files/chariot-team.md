# PIE Chariot Team
- The chariot team normally consisted of two men, the chariot warrior, who concentrated on fighting or hunting, and the charioteer, who drove the horses and took care of them and assisted in other ways as well. It became divinely personifed in the [Twins](divine-twins.md)
- In the Indian epics, the charioteer incorporates the [oral poet](oral-poet.md) and gives the hero advice and encourages him in battle by singing of the feats of his ancestors; hence sūtá- means both ‘charioteer’ and ‘bard’.”
