One of the most suprising places to find syncretism in a religion is in its eschatology. During the end days one is often expected to hold to the beliefs and/or practices of their religion more strongly than before, or perhaps for the first time ever. As the -Terminus post quem- approaches, as the [eschaton bceomes immanentized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanentize-the-eschaton), Orthodox voices begin to demand more and more of devotees. This occurs not only in religions, but in accelerationist political ideologies as well. The mass honor suicides of Japanese civilians near the end of WW2 is one heart wrenching example. 

However, there is a different side to eschatology. Jewett and Lawrence’s work on pop-cultural eschatology, the Christian ending to the apocalyptic Norse text -Vǫluspá,- and even the Book of Revelations are some examples which reveal a deeply syncretic side to eschatology. **In this apper I propose to look at the specifically Islamic and Indo-Iranian form of sycretic eschatology that developed in the aftermath of Islamic conquests of Iran and India.** In the eighth century A.D. anti-Abbasid revolutionary movements lead by men like Behafarid, Sunpadh, and Al-Muqanna fused Islamic and Zoroastrian notions of the apocalypse. Later in 1545 A.D. an Indian Sufi, Mir Sayyid Manjhan Shattari Rajgiri, wrote the -Madhumālatī,- in which he fused incorporated the concept of the Kali Yuga.
