- "`*meh1nōs`, means literally “the measurer”, and is parallel in formation to `*h₂ewsōs` “dawn” (Skt. uṣā́ s, Lat. aurōra, etc.), literally “the kindler” (cp. `*h₂wes-` “to kindle”, OInd. vasati). ==[[matasovic2009-sky]]122==
	- [[dodge-commentary]]: why specifically "kindle" why not just "the shiner"?

### Ancient [[interpretatio]]
Romans connected [[aurora]] and [[mater-matuta]] with the greek [[eos]]
### Diffusion to China
- Several Chinese goddesses are similar to the PIE sun goddess and the dawn goddes, implying influence from them through trade routes in Tocharian territories and therefore their worship there. [[snow-j2002]]
### Shift into folklore (Little Red Riding Hood)
- [[serith-xausos]] sees Little Red Riding Hood as the Dawn goddess and The Big Bad Wolf as the night, from which the dawn has to escape.


## Characteristics
- Xáusōs is the most confidently reconstructed of the Proto-Indo-European goddesses, both by name and by function. Her importance is reflected in Uṣas being the most-invoked goddess in the Rig Veda. ==[[dexter1997-dawn]]:148==
- [[dawn-dances]]
- [[dawn-smiles]]
- She was a beautiful maiden.
- "Keeper of the gates of dawn"?
- [[dawn-is-ambiguous]]

## Family
- Daughter of the [Sky Father](day-sky-father.md). (For more see [[divine-family]]) This was expressed in an epithet: ["Daughter of Dyeus"](epithet--Daughter-of-Dyeus.md)
- She overlaps somewhat with the "Daughter of the Sun" Goddess. In the RV, Uṣas sometimes appears as the daughter of the sun god Sūrya ([[jamison1991]]p294), and is given the title ***sū́ryasya duhitár*** ("Daughter of the Sun"). [[steets1993]] Sees these two figures as the same. For more on this see [[dexter1994]]. #confusing
- see [Dusk](dusk.md)
- In one narrative, Dawn/sun-maiden ([[steets1993]] conflates them) has a surogate mother take care of her children [[narrative-surogate-mother]]
- [[dawns]] / [[dawn-maidens]] / [[dawn-cows]]
- [[dawn-accopanies-divine-twins]]

##  Literal Dawn 
- [[cardinal-directions]] the word "dawn" often meant "east" in various ie branches
- The [[rooster-cock]] was called "Dawn-Singer"

## Rituals
> "Even more than the Sun, the Dawn was a deity not so much to be propitiated and appealed to as simply admired and celebrated in poetic images."==[[west2007]]:218==
