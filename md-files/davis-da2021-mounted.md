## Description
> Horses were domesticated on the Eurasian steppe thousands of years ago and were first used for their milk, meat, and hides. And at some point, people began riding them. But when were they first used in warfare? Where was mounted combat first practiced and who were the first people to perfect it? In this video we're looking at the late Neolithic Yamnaya and Corded Ware cultures, the Bronze Age Sintashta and Andronovo cultures, and the Iron Age Assyrians, Scythians, Saka, and Cimmerians. This is the story of the first horse warriors.
