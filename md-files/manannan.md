# Manannán
§ "[A] sea god...his cloak was like the sea and the waves were his horses."
§ "He was also a magician (like his welsh cognate Manawydan) and he provided help for the Tuatha Dé in their battles, including a boat which obeyed the thoughts of its sailor; a horse which travelled equally happily on sea and land; and a sword, Fragarach ('Answerer'), which could penetrate any armor. [His] magic pigs were symbols of regeneration: they could be killed and eaten on day and alive again the next, ready to be slaughtered for feasting." ~~~THOR'S GOATS



Manannán Mac Lir [MAHN-uh-NAHN mahk Leer]: This root of this god’s name ‘Mannan’ is believed to be the root of the name of the Isle of Man. He is the son of a primal ocean god, Lir (whose name, somehow, Shakespeare got ahold of for the name of his character King Lear). Manannán also presides over the ocean realms, and appears to live apart from the rest of the Tuatha De Danann whose abodes are under the earth. He appears in short episodes in a number of early Irish sources, and seems to have a connection with magic.
