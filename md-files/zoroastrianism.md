## Misc Quotes
> [[denkard]]218: (book 3) "The soul is the lord of this life, and the chieftain of the battle (between good and evil). When the Amahraspands are its assistants, by means of the farohar, [and] the intellect and the vital power, the spiritual agents of the body, it (i. e. the soul) inclines to fight against the druj, and like a heroic person or a valiant man it is the repeller of the druj among (good) creatures by means of its own prowess, and the extricator of the druj from the body. To extricate the druj from the world is to strike, to overpower and to render incapable the Ahriman. The pious man is himself capable of being relieved from the druj."
