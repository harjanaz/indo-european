# Proto-Celtic *Brigantī (Dawn Goddess)
Her name is also an epithet: [[epithet-bhrghntih2-great-lofty]]

### St. Brigit
> "She was born at sunrise on the threshold of the house, her mother having one foot inside, one outside. She was the daughter of the Dagda, the ‘Good God’, or of Dubthach (Dark) son of Dallbrónach (Dark and gloomy). She would only drink milk of a white cow with red ears; reddish cows, as we shall see, are a typical Vedic image of the dawns. She ﬁlled the house with a ﬂame that went up to heaven; the neighbours ran to put the ﬁre out, but found that it had vanished. All of this is singularly appropriate to the Dawn goddess."==[[west2007]]:218==
