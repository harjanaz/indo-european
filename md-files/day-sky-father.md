- Daughter
	- [[epithet--Daughter-of-Dyeus]]
- Wife
	- [[earth-mother]]. There are no good equations for a possible ‘wife’ of father sky, one proposal being a derivative of the same root, PIE `*diu̯ōneh₂` (Grk. `Di[w]ōnē`) See Dunkel (1991) [[klein-et2017-20]]

### Daughters/Associated-Young-Angelic Women
- Odin & Valkyries
- Zeus and his muses. There are 9 of them (just as there are 9 choirs of angels in Christianity). In Hesiod's Theogony Zeus' daughters act like angels or messangers.
- Indra has a host of Apsara (divine women who rode on the clouds and were often depicted with wings). Sometimes they hosted the other Gods and or heroes brought to the heavenly realm (like Valkyrie). They were also his messengers. English translations of the word "Apsara" is sometimes as "nymph", "fairy", "celestial nymph", and "celestial maiden".
- Baal, the sky and storm god, is son of El. Baal is basically taken wholesale and merged with El and made into Yahweh. Baal was lord of hosts. El is lord of hosts. Indra is King of Heaven. King of the Gods. Zeus / Jupiter is seen the same.
## Characteristics
- Had [three eyes](three-eyed-god.md), one in his forehead, to omnipotently see the *three* worlds.

## Branches / Historical Development
- **Originally:** he was the god of the daylight sky and the paternal ruler of heaven. 
- **Classical Branch:** (Grk. Zeus, Lat. Jove/Jupiter) he gained a storm aspect. This aspect could have either been a merging with the PIE storm deity [[thunder-lightning]], and/or, a merging with the Afroasiatic storm god.
- **Celtic Branch** ([[dagda]]) he lost his sky association
- **Germanic Branch**:  the name lived on in [[tyr]] but most of his traits were transfered to the better attested [[odin]] and [[thor]].
