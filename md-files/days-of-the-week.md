## Summary

Between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD the Romans changed their week-day system from the [[nundinae]] to one based on Hellenistic astrology. The Germanics adopted the new system via a process of [[interpretatio]]. There's also the [South Asian systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_days_of_the_week#In_languages_of_the_Indian_subcontinent), which may or may not also be derived from the Hellenistic/Roman system. If the south asian / hindu systems were borrowed, then there was clear [[interpretatio]]. See [[rolinson2018-04-14]] and [[rolinson2019-08-10]].

### Wednesday
|Odin | Mercury
|-|-|
Odin: Wanderer, possessor of hidden wisdom, connected to the Wind mythologically and etymologically (the germanic words for "wind", "woden" "voice", and the latin term "Vates" and sanskrit “Vata” and “Vayu” "nirvana" are all linked) | Mercury, the fleet-footed wanderer who moves with the speed of the wind, and who speaks with the silver-tongue of one who is not always who he seems in both divination and to divinities or men.

Odin :: Rudra/Shiva & Vayu
deities of the howling storm wind connected with wolves, with poetry, with lances and spears and tridents, and with mad, ecstatic, frenzied fighters.

Odin :: Vishnu
The Vedic-era Vishnu was located at the high apex of the heavens
### Thursday
- ‘Storm Lord’, a ‘Jovial’ figure , thunder-weapon, two out of three are both the rulers of their respective pantheons (Jupiter, Vedic Indra)
### Friday
>  Friday’s Deities are a little more complex. There are obvious and well-founded coterminities between Freyja/Frigg and Durga – in both instances, warrior goddesses of fearsome import and well-founded combative reputation, Who are also regarded as possessing a more ‘tender’ side and unparalleled beauty. The difficulty arises in the ‘intermediate’ cultural-religious complex between ‘Vedic’ and ‘Eddic’ that both are “supposed” to have been influenced by according to certain academics – i.e. the Greco-Romans, and their identification of Friday with Aphrodite/Venus. Although despite what one may initially think due to the pop-cultural understandings of the Divinity in question, the connection is not nearly as strained as it may first appear. Venus, for instance, was *also* worshipped as a Goddess of military victory by the Romans – whether due to the patronage role of Venus over one particular Patrician line that eventually gave us both Caesars Julius & Augustus, or possibly due to incorporation via syncreticism of Eastern deities; and we can also find support for Mother Parvati (Durga as Wife rather than Warrior in focus) having functions as a Goddess in connection with love, fertility, and marriage. There is even a speculated etymology which may connect all three sets based around a Proto-Indo-European root “Priho” [‘dear one’] – although while this definitely stands at the origin-point of “Freyja”, and may very well link to “Aphrodite” in a similar manner, the extent to which it may link to “Parvati” is somewhat questionable due to the reasonably well-supported derivation of this name from Proto-Indo-European “Peru” [stone]. Tantalizing hints around the Hittite “Pirwa” must, unfortunately, remain just that for the moment. ([[rolinson2018-04-14]])
### Saturday
Shani :: Saturn - same planet
Shani :: Cronus - crows
