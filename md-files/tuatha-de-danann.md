# Tuatha De Danann

---

- The 5th [invaders of Ireland](invasions-of-ireland.md)

- "The People of the Goddess Danu"

- "After the [their] dispossession...by the Gaels [they]...establish a realm beneath the earth, a mirror-image of the upper world....[they are] able to deprive the Gaels of corn and milk, and they use this power to...bargain with them. So it is by mutual agreement that Ireland is divided into two parts, an upper and lower world. IN their underworld kingdom the Tuatha DÃ© continue to control the supernatural by means of their magic. Each god possesses a sidh (a fairy mound), which is part of the Happy Otherworld."
1. ...perhaps...descendants of the Nemedians, who in their time of exile...learned the mysteries of creation...They brought with them great powers of magic and Druidry, symbolized by four talismans: the Fal Stone, which cried out to announce the true king when he stood on it, Lugh's Spear of Victory, Nuada's (Nuadha or Nuadhu) Undefeatable Sword, and Dagda's (Daghdah or the Dagda) Never Empty Cauldron....[they] were descendants of the mother goddess Danu...
    When the Tuatha arrived...they fought and defeated the Fir Bolg in the first battle of Mag Tuired in which King Nuada lost his arm. Although the arm was replaced with a silver one by Dian Cecht and later with a real one by Dian Cecht's son Miach, Nuada abdicated his position as king because of his weakened condition when the Tuatha were faced with a new battle, this time against the Fomorians, who had returned to Ireland. Bres (the Beautiful One), the son of a Fomorian father and a Tuatha mother, was elected king but when he proved so unsuitable as to elicit the satire of the poet Coibre-- the voice of poets always carried great weight in Ireland--he was asked to resign. Instead he turned to his enemy relatives for support, and the second battle of Mag Tuired resulted. Before the battle, Nuada was restored to the throne, but he soon ceded his power Lugh, who came to Tara and proved his ability to call successfully upon magical powers. Lugh led the battle, finally facing the horrid Balar, who killed both Nuada and Queen Macha and whose dreadful one eye could destroy whole armies. With his slingstone, Lugh hit Balar's eye. The stone forced the eye back through the demon's skull and turned its evil powers against the Fomorians, who were themselves destroyed and removed from Ireland forever. Bres was captured but allowed to live in return for revealing Fomorian secrets of agriculture. Like the Norse Vanir, and the Greek and Vedic Giants...the Fomorians represented the powers of both fertility and destructions that exist together in nature."
