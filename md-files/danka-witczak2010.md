## Abstract
> It should be concluded that the inscriptional phrase DEIS EQUEUNUBO had to refer to the Celtic (or Lusitanian) twin gods. The term EQUE(h)UNU seems a descriptive by-name of the Celtic divine twins, like Vedic _Aśvināu_ (liter. ‘two horse-like [deities]’), Greek _Διόσκουροι_ (liter. ‘Zeus’ boys’) or Etruscan _Tinascliniiaras_ (liter. ‘to the sons of [the sky-god] Tin’).
