> An earlier form of this paper was published as “The Frightful Goddess: Birds, Snakes and Witches,” 1 a paper I wrote for a Gedenkschrift which I co-edited in memory of Marija Gimbutas. Several years later, in June of 2005, I gave a lecture on this topic to Ivan Marazov’s class at the New Bulgarian University in Sophia. At Ivan’s request, I updated the paper. Now, in 2011, there is a lovely synchrony: I have been asked to produce a paper for a Festschrift in honor of Ivan’s seventieth birthday, and, as well, a paper for an issue of the Institute of Archaeomythology Journal in honor of what would have been Marija Gimbutas’ ninetieth birthday. I dedicate this paper, in two somewhat different forms, to both Marija and Ivan, two broad-thinking scholars and teachers who have given deep insights into antiquity.
