# In Aquilonem Nocturnum

#### To the nighty North-wind

Shut up, wind!
you know never
moderation for men, 
long quiet nights
when you in a-cold-way
gust through the roof-grass



Knock it off, wind--
you never give
a hoot for human beings!
Night seems endless
when--nipping cold!--
you gust through the grass on the roof.



Shut up wind!
you never think 
to stop yourself for us...
Nights are long and boring
when you coldly gust
through the roof grass.
