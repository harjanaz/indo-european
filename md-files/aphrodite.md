# Aphro-dítē
Sea-foam-shine

> Wiktionary:
> "In an older position now rejected a Greek etymology is proposed, connecting -δίτη (-dítē) with the verb δέατο (déato, “to shine, to appear, seem”) (Homeric δῆλος (dêlos, “visible, conspicuous, clear”)) and interpret the name as originating from an [epithet](epithet--Daughter-of-Dyeus.md) of the dawn goddess Ἠώς (Ēṓs)."
