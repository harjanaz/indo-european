The following is from the Zoroastrian sacred book "Vendidad" ("The Laws Against The Demons") written before the 8th century BC:
 
19.Ia.6-7
 
The prophet Zarathustra is out walking around killing demons with powerful stones given to him by the good God Ahura Mazda. The evil God, Angra Mainyu, confronts him about this:
 
"...to (Zarathustra) said the the maker of the evil world, Angra Mainyu: 'Do not destroy my creatures!...renounce the good Religion of the worshipers of Mazda, and thou shalt gain such a boon as Vadhaghna gained, the ruler of nations.'" [*Vadhaghna ruled for a thousand years]
 
7. "...Zarathustra said in answer: 'No! Never will I renounce the good Religion...'"
 
Compare:

 
Matthew 4:8-11 KJV
 
"...the devil took (Jesus) up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, "All these things I will give You if You fall down and worship me." Then Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve,' Then the devil left Him..."
