## Abstract
This paper looks at ancient Egyptian funerary practices and the widely-known Egyptian funeral myth of Isis, Nephthys, Osiris, and Set to draw new lines of connection with the Christian mythos around Mary Magdalene and her role during the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. Particularly, this paper presents that the mythic figure of Mary Magdalene shows startling correlations in ritual and myth to Isis’s funerary roles in the Isis-Osiris myth. Through rituals of anointing and mourning, together with mythological and historical criteria that determined the right to rule, the mythic synchronicities between the nascent Christian myth of Jesus and Mary Magdalene with the ancient Isis-Osiris myth are compelling.
