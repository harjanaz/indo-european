## Dual Aspect: dying young
- The youthful warrior knows he may die, and even desires death insofar as it provides [[fame-renown-glory-memory-heard-tales]].
- Death makes us human, makes us **mortal** (PIE [`*mr̥tós`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/mr̥tós) from [`√*mer`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/mer-) 'to die').  So it was fitting when the Old Indic warriors were called *márya* "young warrior" or *marut* "chariot warrior". The mortal ones.
- Vegetal imagery in Homer about achilles etc.
