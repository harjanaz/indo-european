### Sacred-Groves [[groves]] Influence on Estonian (*hiis*)
Estonian hiis ("sacred grove")
Cognate with Finnish Finnish hiisi and Livvi hiiži (“devil”). 
The original meaning in Proto-Finnic was most likely "burial ground". 
Possibly a loan from Proto-Germanic *χīđiz (“den, thicket”) or *sīdǭ (“side”).
