## Interpretations
In his work Alwah Imadi, [[suhrawardi]] offers an esoteric interpretation of Ferdowsi's Epic of Kings (Shah Nama) in which figures such as Fereydun, Zahak, Kay Khusraw and Jamshid are seen as manifestations of the divine light. ([[m-razavi1997]]). [Seyyed Hossein Nasr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seyyed-Hossein-Nasr "Seyyed Hossein Nasr") states: "Alwah 'Imadi is one of the most brilliant works of Suhrawardi in which the tales of ancient Persia and the wisdom of gnosis of antiquity in the context of the esoteric meaning of the Quran have been synthesized".
