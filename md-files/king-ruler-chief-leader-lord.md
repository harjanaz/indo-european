### **Caesar and Kesarī**

> Indian kings used the title Kesarin केसरिन् or Kesarī (for lion), and a dynasty that ruled in east India for three centuries was called Kesarī. The title Kesarī was used in India in the same manner as the Roman Caesar (Latin pronunciation = ˈkae̯.sar) from which Kaiser (German) and Tsar or Czar (Russian) are derived. There is no evidence that the usage in India was a borrowing from Rome.
> 
> Pliny derives Caesar from caesaries or “full head of hair”, because the future ruler was born thus. The word was elevated to a title after Caius Julius Caesar (100 BCE — 44 BCE) became dictator and later it was used by emperors down to Hadrian (138 CE).
> 
> In Sanskrit, the word kesarin(having a mane) comes from the word kesara, one of whose meanings is hair. Male lions, horses and some monkeys have mane, so each of them can be called by this word. In the plant kingdom, kesara refers to filament of any flower and thus to saffron. But mostly Kesarī केसरी means a lion. An equivalent title in India that was used by kings is that of Siṃha सिंह, which is familiar to all in the spelling “Singh”. In the Rāmāyaṇa, the father of the hero Hanuman is Kesarī.
> 
> The correspondence between Sanskrit and Latin for this word is quite striking. Is it just the word derived from the non-existent mother language or obtained through diffusion? We know that there was commerce between ancient India and Rome so the idea of diffusion in both directions cannot be ruled out.
