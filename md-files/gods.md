There were many pie gods, and there are many different ways we could define them and categorize them:
- **By Concept**: there were two main categories, [Nature Gods](nature-gods.md) and [Social Gods](social-gods.md). Some gods fit in both, some neither, but most do. And most of the nature gods have to do with the celestial realm (day and night skies), the most sterotypical being the Sky Father.
- [By Gender](gods-by-gender.md) 
- **Anthropomorphic**
	- **By Social Organization**: Some of them were apart of a [[divine-family]]
	- **By Gender**: [Male](gods-male.md) vs [Female](goddesses.md)
- **By Historical Branch** [->](gods-by-branch.md)
- [Other ways of organizing them, and misc notes](gods-misc-notes.md)

## Gods vs Humans
One handy way to understand them is by comparing them to humans by focusing on their Homeland and Constitution. See the page [[humans-vs-gods]] for more.
- (1) Many gods are celestial, that is, located in the sky/heaven. Often capable of flight.
- (2) All are free from [[death-decay]], which means in turn they are:
	- Endowed with a perfect [[body]]
	- Not subject to [[health-medic-sick-ill-pain-disease]].
	- Not subject to [[age]]
	- Not compelled to [eat food](food-eating.md), or if they do eat food it is nectar/ambrosia/basically-divine-preservative
	-  Have an infinite amount of [[time]] to life their lives, to use their lifeforce
	-  Called  `*n̥-mr̥tōs` "immortal, un-dying" (Grk. *ámbrotoi*, Lat. *dī immortales*, etc.).

## Etymology
There were a couple terms for "the divine" in PIE.  
- The first `*dei̯u̯ós` was derived from the [[day-sky-father]]'s name and literally means a "heavenly one". 
- Another  was 	`*dʰeh₁s-` (as in Grk *theós* "god", Arm *dik'* "gods", Lat. *fēriae* "holi-days"). It was probably related to `*dheh1-` ("put, place").
