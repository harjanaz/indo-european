# PII Animal Sacrifice `PII *yagna` 
- (Skt. *yajñá*; Av. *yasna*; cognant with Eng. hagio-)
- Came to mean simply "sacrifice/worship" in both Indic and Iranian branches, but originally referred to bloody animal sacrifices.
- More expensive than Pouring Sacrifices, and used for important occasions
- Domestic livestock (PII `*pasu`; Skt. *páśu-*; Av. *pasu-*), not wild animals, were used (goats, sheep, cattle, horses).

In return you will recieve men and cattle (i.e. pastoralist wealth). Additionally you will re-creating and re-affirming the first sacrifice ([[narrative-pii-creation]]).
