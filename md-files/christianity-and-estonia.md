Churches
	"…big popular meetings and offerings [were made] at churches occurred at holidays…" (p.572)
	
	"Let's become one spirit and one heart against the christian name", as Lembitu, the Estonian chief,

Chapels
	Offerings were made at "numerous local chapels" (p.572)
	
Syncretism is reflected also in the way that people attempted ritual communication with deities. First, the parallel worship of spiritual beings of different religious background can be observed. Evidently, the authority and power of God in the Christian sense was accepted soon after the conquest…trust in powers of non-Christian origin persisted.

The same congregation members who visited churches on Sundays made offerings to holy stones and house spirits….popular religion [is] free from 'ideological' limitations…help is help, no matter from which source it comes.

Ancient attitudes, beliefs and concepts also exist among modern populations and in some cases a continuous connection with pre-Christian traditions can be observed. Animistic approaches to things, using nature as a source of energy, and belief in contacts with the dead are still realities for many people, both in town and the countryside. The situation seems to reflect a general principle which was also expresses in the greater persistence of sacred natural sites as compared with Catholic chapels: archaic layers of beliefs and attitudes tend to survive longer than Christian ones of later origin.

only the most important of the local gods was deemed to have been toppled at the same time as the indigenous human lords. Minor deities and their functions survived, just as the less important peoples had survived. Christianity could not bring sustenance to these people until they had been set free; until then lakes, trees, and rocks provided spiritual support and seemed nearer to life's ultimate purpose
