# Pryderi
· Son of Pwyll and Rhiannon
· "When three nights old, he [was] stolen while his watch-women are asleep, and Rhiannon is wrongly blamed for his murder."
· "...the story contains considerable elements of myth: he disappears on the eve of 1 May, the great spring festival of Beltene; and his earliest life is closely associated with that of the foal, which is also taken on May-eve. (This affinity with horses is linked with that of his mother.) Finally the kidnapping of Pryderi when three nights old is precisley similar to the fate of the young Mabon, the Welsh hunter-god of Culhwch and Olwen...Celtic conception tales such as this, surrounded by curious events, may be symbolic of the trancendental meaning of birth--a child born of earthly parents but also the incarnation of supernature essence--expressed by myth. (Similar mystery...surrounds the birth of Christ.)"
