This site has three interconnected sections:

- [[biblio]]
- [[content]]

The best way to get started is just by searching and playing around!


## Ex.
The topical page [[earth]] has links to various sub-topical pages, biblio pages, external links, and to the semantic field page [[buck-1.21-earth-land]] which inturn contains various etymons (pokonry, watkins, etc.). The basic topical page is for the topic as a whole, while the semantic field page is strictly for poetics. 


The content pages are organized by linguistic family (indo-iranian, balto-slavic, etc.); ages (copper, bronze age, etc.); and every other concievable hierarchical organizing pattern. I do this to create a hyper-interlinked yet also hyper-organized wiki structure. One can go "up" and "down" a page just as easily as you can go "side-to-side".
