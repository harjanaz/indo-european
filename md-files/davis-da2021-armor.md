## Description
> When did metal armour first emerge in Europe? Where was it first developed? What about the first metal helmets and shields? And what can all this armour tell us about its users and the societies they came from? The Dendra Panoply of Mycenaean Greece is famous, as is the boar's tusk helmet. But bronze armour was worn right across Europe and warriors defended themselves with circular bronze shields and bronze helmets. This is the story of European Bronze Age armour.
