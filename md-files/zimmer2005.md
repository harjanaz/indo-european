KEY WORDS: Old Irish cethr-ochair, Middle Welsh pedry-dant, Sanskrit catur-aśra-, heroic epithets, Indo-European poetics.

## Abstract
> Old Irish *cethr-ochair*, Middle Welsh *pedry-dant* (and similar formations), if used as heroic epithets, are not to be understoood literally. The Sanskrit parallel *catur-aśra* helps to understand how words for ‚rectangular‘, vel sim., could acquire a meaning ‚perfect‘, vel sim. This note argues for inheritance of that peculiar usage from Indo-European poetics. Etymology points to a special bellicose connotation.
