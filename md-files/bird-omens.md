[[birds]], [[omens]]

---

The most obvious connection between priests and birds is the ritual of Ornithomancy/Augury ([[bird-omens]]) (Greek, Roman, Celts, Germans, etc.) This ritual links gods, birds, and priests. The gods send messages regarding the future to the human world through the behavior of birds. This behavior includes both the movement and cry of the birds. This behavior is interpreted by priests.
