## Web Resource: The Linguistics Research Center
The [LRC](https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/) is home to a vast store of useful IE information ranging from [Tocharian Lessons](https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol) to a Metrically Restored Edition of the [RigVeda](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/lrc/rigveda/index.php). [Todd Krause](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/lrc/about/print-publications/todd-b-krause.php) is the friendly web master over there and knows everything there is to know about IE databases.
