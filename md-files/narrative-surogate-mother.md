> "...the child(ren) of the sun maiden are entrusted to the care of the substitute: Saranyu' s savarna is entrusted with Saranyii's children, and Macha's king's sister acts as a "substitute" mother in Macha's unexplained absence. In the Welsh version, Rhiannon's child and the foal born simultaneously are given to Teymon's wife to raise. The substitute female implicitly or explicitly promises to treat the child(ren) as her own; this promise is fulfilled in the Irish and Welsh versions and transgressed in the Vedic one."
