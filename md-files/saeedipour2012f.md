## Abstract
Without scrutinizing the meaning, vitality, and significance of the rta in the Rig Veda, one can not appropriately approach those complicated and complex events and conducts like the Yama-Yami drama. The Rta is the dominant regulator and observed direction in the Rig Veda. It is the law of justified order of things and conduct. The sun, the moon, the stars, seas, oceans, and the phenomena of nature with human beings are ordered according to the rta. The rta is the controlling authority and core of the universe. It seems to be the unchanging law in the Vedic tradition In addition it also appears to be the moral codes of conduct of both the deities and mortal creatures. The rta is called holy law by the clever rsis and supported by the great lords of Deities like VARUNA, INDRA, MITRA, and ARYAMAN. No mortal and immortal creatures should violate the rta.

Yama could not have done but right deed. Otherwise the incest of Yama would have fumed furious anger of the lords of adityas of the Vedic Aryans.
