*<p style="text-align:center">I dedicate this site<br>to [those ancient cowboys](bovines.md)<br>whose languages, cultures, and descendants<br>cover the earth.</p>*

Welcome to *indo-european.wiki*,  a site which aims to gather all information on reconstructed Indo-European culture in one place. You'll find pages on everything from poetic [[formulas]], to prehistoric [gods](gods.md), [conversion](syncretism-conversion-isation.md), and even some other proto-peoples like the [proto-austronesians](baldick2013.md). It contains over 7000 pages as of Feb 3rd 2022. 

Learn more [[about]] the project, go to the [[home]] page, or meet the curator [Erick Dodge](dodge.md).
