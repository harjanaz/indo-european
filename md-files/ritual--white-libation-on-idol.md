[Wiktionary: aurr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aurr)
### Indic
> The word being utilized to translate as ‘clay’ – ‘auri’ – isn’t exactly ‘clay’, but rather connotes a wet substance (in fact, given the white liquid of the relevant Wellspring of Urðr is the key ingredient, the Bellows translation not unreasonably has ‘Water’ in lieu of ‘Clay’ there for the libation); and to my mind, recalls our smearing of the [ShivLing](shiva-linga.md) with light-coloured ritual unguents – or, for that matter, the rather thicker nature of a Panchamrut [Panchamrit – Five-Element Amrit] libation due to the yoghurt / curd etc. involved (along with the Honey, jaggery (raw cane sugar), ghee, and of course, the milk … a pointedly white liquid of life).
