 # The Magic (`*māyā`) Knowing (`*mazdʰáH` ) Lord (`*Hásuras`)
 
 
## Forms
Iranian **Ahura Mazdā**
Vedic **Váruṇa**

## Characteristics
Scholars use to see him as a sky god, and mistakenly linked Váruṇa with Greek [[ouranos]]. Later scholars, including [[lincoln1981]]p57- saw them as follows:
	- concerned with sovereignty
	- connected to, but not identical with, the [[sky]]. Highest and thus all seeing and thus all knowing
	- **Wise/Knowledgeable**. Ahura Mazdā means literally "Knowing Lord" and Váruṇa is characterized as Skt. *medhira-* "knowing/wise" and *pracetā* "wise". What specific kind of knowledge is meant? Magic (Skt. māyā, Av. hu-māyā) that was used to create the world.
