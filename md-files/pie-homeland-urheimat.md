## Name
Ireland [[isaac2009]] ("abundant-land")
Iran ("Land of the Iranians")


## Formation and Development
The PIEs didn't pop out of no-where:

1. They began as Foragers/Fishers/Hunters
2. Cattle Herding borrowed from Old Europeans
	1. This is the stage in which the [[first-sacrifice]] and [first-warrior](narrative--first-warrior-trito.md) narratives could have first developed
	2. Note: grave mounds with intered coffins may also have been borrowed from them?
	3. "In the east, cattle and sheep were more important in ritual sacrifices than in the diet, as if they were initially regarded as a kind of ritual currency used for occasional (seasonal?) sanctified meals and funeral feasts. They certainly were associated with new rituals at funerals, and probably with other new religious beliefs and myths as well. The set of cults that spread with the first domesticated animals was at the root of the Proto-Indo-European conception of the universe as described at the beginning of chapter 8." [[anthony]]p186
3. Domestication of the Horse
