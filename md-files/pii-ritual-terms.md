### Utilized in a Specific Order 
> {[[watkins1995ch21]]p236}:
> "...the terms [strength, libation, glory, plenty]  tend to occur in the same order in both Iran and India when two or more appear together. We have here a common Indo-Iranian semantic and sequential "program" which can be poetically encoded both into the [strophic style of "ryhthmic prose"](strophic-style.md), as in [Iranian](iranian-strophic-style.md), and into the metrical strophic verse of vedic hymnic poetry."
