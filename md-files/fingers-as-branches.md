> Op. 742–3: 
> μηδ᾽ ἀπὸ πεντόζοιο θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαλείῃ αὗον ἀπὸ χλωροῦ τάμειν αἴθωνι σιδήρῳ 
> and do not cut the dry off from the green from the five-branched one with gleaming iron at the gods’ feast.
> This example involves a kenning that is part of an extended riddling description of a ritual taboo for which we have no clear information. πέντοζος, the five-branched, is the hand [Note: Rouse 1929 compares Ṛg Veda 10.137.7 ‘with this pair of hands ten-branched we will touch thee’ and suggests that this must have been part of the poetic inheritance. And West ad loc. cites ‘fivebranched’ for hand. Bornmann 1970: 104–5 points out (cf. above, p. 191 n. 9) that some of Hesiod’s kennings occur in ritual prohibitions (vv. 750 ἀκίνητα, 755–6 ἀίδηλα), and proposes that we may be dealing with the survival of an ancient expression rooted in magical beliefs. West 2007: 82 speaks (in the context of πέντοζος et sim.) of possibly ‘an ancient Indo-European metaphor capable of conversion into a kenning’. See also Bader 1989: 105–6.] ([[vergados2020]]p198n26)
