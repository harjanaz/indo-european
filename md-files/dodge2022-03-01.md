> You noted that "...the offerings of white liquid [in the norse texts]...are quite directly cognate to...the libations we pour upon the ShivLing." I wrote about these liquids (at the time I called them "structurally equivalent liquids") and their connection to the axis mundi in my thesis (available at [https://indo-european.wiki/dodge2020-thesis](https://indo-european.wiki/dodge2020-thesis?fbclid=IwAR2vHuVWaafc_YbUHmKl9a4tZGW0Vwfd_vXVwNkMB2ktn4b872Q_kyA1GVM)) [[dodge2020-thesis]] in Section 2.3.4 on page 26 and Section 3.1.2.4 on page 43. I was mostly looking at cosmology and myth, nice that you noted the linga, it reveals a ritual aspect I didn't think about. Very cool!
