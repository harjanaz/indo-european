## Notes
Polome initially proposed an etymological connection between *alu* and: 

- Hitt.  ***alwanza***  'cast a spell'  

- Gk.  ***alúō***  'I am beside myself' 

- Gk.  ***alússō***  'I am agitated'

- Gk.  ***aláomai***  'I wander to and fro'

- Latv.  ***aluôt(iês)***  'wander to and fro'

- Latv.  ***āᶅuôtiês***  'howl, behave in a crazed manner'

From these he formulated a PIE verbal stem:  ****al-w-*** 

Later, the Hittite connection was conntested  [(e-neu1974p77n139)]((e-neu1974).md)

Later, [(g-host1980p49)]((g-host1980).md) asserted that the appearence of the word for 'beer' on a gravstone signifies that the burial feast (Norw. *gravølet* 'grave-beer') has taken place and the traditional ritual was followed according to the perscribed custom. On the interpretation of the Tune stone's *arbij* as burial feast, see (e-antonsen 1986).

Later, the overall idea was supported [(e-antonsen1988p52-4)]((e-antonsen1988).md) and added to:

- PGmc.  ****aluþ***  '*beer*'  must be derived from this same PIE stem and would have originally meant  '*that which induces the ecstatic state*'.  ***alu*** would have refered to the ecstatic state itself.  On a cult-stone or other object ***alu***  would indicate that the object has been consecrated, perhaps by being sprinkled with beer as suggested by [(g-host1980p45)]((g-host1980).md).

  

Later, this etymology was proven faulty (was it? in what way?) and subsequently dropped by Polomé, though he continues [[polome1995]] to suggest that a common semantic denominator connects these words with *alu*.
