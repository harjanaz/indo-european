## Abstract
> In this article it is argued that the traditional figure of the Armenian folklore “black youth” is derived from the members of the war-band of the thunder god, mythological counterparts of the archaic war-bands of youths. The blackness of the youths is associated with igneous initiatory rituals. The best parallels of the Armenian heroes are found in Greece, India, and especially in Ossetia and other Caucasian traditions, where the Indo-European (particularly Alanian-Ossetian) influence is significant.
