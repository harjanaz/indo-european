## Abstract
> In the following representation of an email conversation that took place May 6 – June 2, 2018, Natasha Bershadsky, Gregory Nagy, Douglas Frame, and Andrea Debiasi engage in an intergenerational exchange of research, debating the vexed question of the nature of the Lelantine War, working out its connections with the Samian epic _The Sack of Oikhalia_ and with poetic traditions of Homer and Hesiod.

_Title_: “Further thoughts on the Heracles tradition of Greek epic”  
_Abstract_: In [[davidson1980]] Davidson reinforces [[dumezil]]’s work comparing three warrior figures in three related traditions, Greek, Indic, and Germanic. She shows how the Greek figure, Heracles, with an epic tradition of his own in Greek, was put to use in Homeric epic for ends of its own. I offer here further thoughts on the Heracles tradition and the poets who carried this tradition on, the Kreophyleioi of Samos. Homeric tradition, after the creation of the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ in a context of Panionism, became the possession of the Homeridai of Chios. The two guilds of poets, Homeridai on Chios and Kreophyleioi on Samos—both islands were members of the Ionian dodecapolis—invite probing from the standpoint of historical context and likely rivalry.
