## Analysis
> "...the killing of the son effectively places limitations on the achievement of warrior prowess, isolates the hero from time by cutting off his generational extension, and also reestablishes the hero's typical adolescence by depriving him of a role (as father) in an adult world." ([[mallory-adams-d1997]]p533 "Son's Death")
