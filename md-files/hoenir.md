# Norse Hoenir

"We know almost nothing about Hoenir. He is one of Odin's brothers, and, as part of the Odin-Lodur-Hoenir trio, created mankind from driftwood; this gives him some creator god aspects.  It is important to note that there are two separate records of the three original creator gods. The second trio is Odin-Vili-Ve. We do not know why there are two different versions of the same myth. This may be due to differing geographical beliefs or may simply mean that these were both written down and preserved in different teat.  Hoenir is one of the hostages sent from the Aesir to Vanir as part of their peace treaty. Hoenir is also known to be slow of speech. After Ragnarök, he returns to Asgard to take up the role of godhi (roughly meaning priest) for the new gods. This not only suggests that he lives through the destruction, but also leads to an interesting little speculation about Vanaheim's survival rate as well. It seems logical that an As surviving Ragnarök must have had a place to do just that, and at the time he is living in Vanaheim." [1]
