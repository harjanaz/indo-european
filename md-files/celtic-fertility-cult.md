- "the Irish and Welsh image of goddesses such as Macha, Medb and Modron...[In] Romano-Celtic Europe: she was depicted…as a triad, and epigraphy…refer[s] to the goddess as the Deae Matres or Deae Matronae. This tripleism seems to occur most frequently in the imagery of divine beings associated with prosperity and well-being. The Mothers…appear…with…babies, fruit or bread. A typical Burgundian image, exemplified by a relief at Vertault, shows the goddesses with a baby, a napkin or towel and a sponge and basin. The Germanic Matronae were topographical goddesses, with local surnames such as Aufaniae. They carry fruit rather than emblems of human fertility, [and[ are distinctive in that their images always depict two older goddesses flanking a young girl…The British mother-goddesses are depicted both with children and fruit or bread; they cluster in two geographical groups, that of the West Country and that of Hadrian's Wall.
