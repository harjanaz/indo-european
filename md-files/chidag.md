<pre>

It is faith that searches out causes,
    palpable and as they are,
and then, acting as mediator by means of reason,
    passes them on.

====ORIGINS====

This must one know without a doubt:
	I wasn't always on this earth.
	I've come from the unseen world,
	I wasn't made, I was thought.
	I belong
		to God (Ohrmazd), 
			not to Satan (Ahriman).
		I belong to the gods (Yazads),
   	 		not to the demons (Devs),
		to good,
    		not to evil.
	I'm a 
		man,
    		not a demon,
		a creature of God (Ohrmazd),
    		not of Satan (Ahriman).
		My stock and lineage is from Gayomard. 
		My mother is Earth (Spandarmad),
			and my father is God (Ohrmazd). 
		My humanity is from Mashye and Mashyane,
			who were the first seed and offspring of Gayomard. 

===FUNCTION, DUTY, BELIEF=====

To perform my function and do my duty means that:
	I should believe 
		that God (Ohrmazd) is, was, and evermore shall be,
		that his Kingdom is undying, 
	that he is infinite and pure;
		and that Satan (Ahriman) is not, and is destructible; 
	that I myself belong to Ohrmazd and his Amesha Spentas.
    	and that I have no connection with Satan (Ahriman), the demons, and their associates.

My first duty on earth is 
	to confess the Religion,
		to practice it,
		and to take part in its worship and to be steadfast in it,
	to keep the Faith in the Good Religion of the worshippers of Ohrmazd ever in my mind,
	and to distinguish:
		profit from loss,
		sin from good works,
		good from evil,
		light from dark,
		and the worship of (God) Ohrmazd from the worship of the demons (Devs).

My second duty is to take a wife
	and to procreate earthly offspring,
	and to be strenuous and steadfast in this.

My third duty is to cultivate and till the soil.

My fourth duty is to treat all livestock justly.

My fifth duty is
	to spend a third of my days and nights in attending the seminary and consulting the wisdom of holy men,
	to spend a third of my days and nights in tilling the soil and in making it fruitful,
	and to spend the remaining third of my days and nights in eating, rest, and enjoyment.

I must have no doubt: 
that profit arises from good works,
    and loss from sin,
that my friend is God (Ohrmazd)
    and my enemy Satan (Ahriman), 
and that there is only one religion, that of:
    good thoughts,
    good words,
    and good deeds, 
        the way of Heaven,
        of light and purity,
        of the Infinite Creator,
            God (Ohrmazd),
            who was always and will ever be.
I must also have no doubt that there is another way
of evil thoughts,
evil words,
and evil deeds,
    the way of darkness, 
    and of the finiteness, utter misery, death, and wickedness
which belong to the Satan (accursed Destructive Spirit, Ahriman)
who once was not in this creation,
and again will not be in the creation of God (Ohrmazd),
and who in the end will be destroyed.

I must have no doubt:
that there are two first principles,
one the Creator
and the other the Destroyer.
The Creator is God (Ohrmazd)
    who is all goodness and all light
The Destroyer is Satan (the accursed Destructive Spirit)
    who is all wickedness and full of death,
    a liar and a deceiver.

I must have no doubt that:
all men are mortal
except only Soshyans,
and the seven kings who help him.

I must have no doubt:
that my soul (jan) will leave my body
and my body will be dissolved.

Nor may I doubt
the three nights judgment of the soul at death,
the raising of the dead
the Final Body the crossing of the Bridge of the Requiter (Chinwad),
the coming of the Soshyans,
and the raising of the dead and the Final Body.


========ETHICS==========

I must observe:
the law of chivalry (erih)
and the Religion of the Ancients.



With all good men I must observe the law of chivalry,
peace and concord in all good deeds I do.
In my dealing with the good I must always behave according to justice and the dictates of the Good Religion.
With whomsoever it may be, in past, present, and future time, I must act in a common virtue and in a common righteousness (ham-datastan).

Good deeds performed for the sake of the Law are of a higher value than those performed for one's own sake, and by them is salvation most assured.

========================



I declare that
I have received the Good Religion of the worshippers of Ohrmazd
    and have no doubts concerning it
    not for any bodily or spiritual comfort that it may bring,
    not for a pleasant life or for a long life,
    nor yet because I know that my mind will part company with my body.
I shall never apostatize from
    the Good Religion of the worshippers of God (Ohrmazd),
    and I have no doubts concerning it.
I neither approve of nor adhere to other religions.

I must preserve:
my thoughts in righteousness,
my tongue in truth,
and my hands in doing what is good.

For it is plain that of thoughts, words, and deeds it is only deeds that are the criterion:
for the will is unstable,
thought is impalpable,
but deeds are palpable indeed,
and it is by their deeds that men are made known.


In Man's body three roads have been laid out.
On these three roads three gods (menok, spirits) dwell,
and three demons (Druj) seek to waylay.
In thought Vohuman, (the Good Mind), has his dwelling,
    and Wrath seeks to waylay.
In words Wisdom has its dwelling,
    and Heresy (varan) seeks to waylay;
In deeds the Bounteous Spirit (Ohrmazd) has his dwelling,
    and the Destructive Spirit (Ahriman) seeks to waylay.
On these three roads Man must stand firm,
    nor may he give up his heavenly (menok) reward
    for the sake of worldly goods, wealth, or earthly desire.
    For the man who does (not) guard these three bastions within
    his body which I have mentioned: 
    his thoughts proceed from evil thought,
    his words from evil speech,
    and his deeds from evil deeds.

====SAVING YOURSELF VIA GOOD DEEDS=====    

I be thankful/gratful;
that it is within my power to my keep soul (ruvan) from Hell.
For when a man passes from the loins of his father into the womb of his mother,
then does Death (Astwihad, 'the Dissolver of Bones' the demon of death), secretly (menokiha) cast a halter round his neck which for his whole life's span cannot be shaken off,
not through the power of a good spirit and not through the power of an evil spirit;
but after he has passed away, that halter falls from off the neck of the man who is saved through the good deeds that he has done, but the man who is damned is dragged to Hell by that very halter.



Parents must teach their children this much concerning
good works before they reach their fifteenth year.
If they do, the may claim credit (?) for the good deeds of the child;
but if the child has not been properly instructed,
then the parents are responsible for their evil deeds.

Take great care never to vex your father and mother or your superior lest your body become ill-famed (thereby) and your soul see damnation.



Do good works and do not have any part in sin.
Be grateful for good things,
content in adversity,
long-suffering in affliction (astanak),
zealous in the performance of your duty.

Repent of all your sins,
    and do not allow any sin that brings punishment with it
    to remain unconfessed for even a moment.

Overcome
    doubts (varan) and unrighteous desires with reason (khrat)
    concupiscence (Az) with contentment,
    anger with serenity (Srosh),
    envy with benevolence (huchashmih),
    want with vigilance,
    strife (anashtih) with peace,
    falsehood with truth.

Know that Heaven is the best place,
that the kingdom of the spirit (menok) is the most pleasurable,
that the mansions (deh) of the sky are the most luminous,
that Paradise (Garothman) is a shining house,
and that the doing of good works brings great hope of the Final Body which passes not away.

So far as lies within your power,
do not pay respect to evil men,
for by commending what is wrong evil enters into your body
and good is driven out.

Be diligent in the acquisition of learning (*frahang*),
for learning is the seed of knowledge,
and its fruit is wisdom,
and wisdom rules both worlds.
Concerning this it has been said that learning is an adornment in prosperity, a protection in hard times, a ready helper in affliction (astanak),
a guide in distress.

Do not make mock of anyone at all;
for the man who mocks will himself be mocked,
will lose his dignity (khwarrah) and be execrated;
and rarely indeed will he have a decent or warlike son.

Seek every day the company of good men to ask their advice,
    for he who makes a habit of seeking the company of good men,
    will be blessed with a greater share of virtue and holiness.

Gothree times a day to the Fire Temple and do homage to the Fire;
    for he who makes a habit of it will be blessed with wealth and holiness.


Know that of all the countless adversities that the accursed
Destructive Spirit devised these three are the most grievous:
blindness,
deafness, 
and the Lie of discord (anashtih).
For it is revealed 
that for this reason does the Sun issue his command to men on 
earth three times a day.
At dawn he says:
    "Ohrmazd ever bids you who are men
    to be diligent in the doing of good works
    so that I may bestow earthly life upon you."
At midday he says:
    "Be diligent in seeking out a wife, in the procreation 
    of children, and in your other duties,
    for until the Final Body (comes to pass)
    the Destructive Spirit and his abortions will 
    not be separated from this world."
At eventide he says, 
    "Repent of the sins you have committed
    that I may have compassion on you."
For it is revealed:
    that just as the light of theSun comes down to earth,
    so do his words come to earth.

In this material world do not
think, say, or do
what is wrong(false) in
thought, word, or deed.

Through the power of the gods,
by way of wisdom
and by consultation with the Religion
be vigilant and zealous (for good works),
and consider that since the value of good works is so great and limitless, the Destructive Spirit strives his utmost to conceal this truth and to cause
you misery,
and Ohrmazd strives his utmost to reveal the truth.
Whosoever has knowledge of the Religion,
let him be diligent in the doing of good works
and be forever steadfast therein.

At the end of this millennium
when the wickedness of the demons knows no limit
    and the Religion of Ohrmazd is much reduced
    and that of the unrighteous is predominant,
when discussions
    concerning the Law and Religion
    between good and righteous men who know their duty,
    have ceased
when the deeds of Ahriman and the demons
    are done openly

— and the sign of this will be that there will be 
a (general) retrogression when creatures will be destroyed, those 
who break contracts and who have taken the part of the demons 
and opposed the religion will go free, and when throughout the
length and breadth of the lands which acknowledge the Law of Ohrmazd
(all) good creatures will despair on account of wicked tyrants 
(*azhidahakan*), — then every man must add to his (inner) peace 
through (the power of) Vohuman, (the Good Mind), consult with 
Wisdom through the Religion, search out the way of holiness by 
wisdom, rejoice his soul by means of generosity, show honor to 
rank by benevolence, seek a good name by manliness, collect friends 
by humility, make hope acceptable by long-suffering, store up 
(for himself) goodness by temperance (*khem*), and prepare the way 
to bright heaven by righteousness; for there shall he enjoy the 
fruits of his good works.

(55) The body is mortal but the soul is immortal. Do good works,
for the soul is (real), not the body, the next world is (real),
not this world. (56) Do not abandon the care of the soul and forget
it for the body's sake. (57) Out of respect for persons (and out
of forgetfulness) that all the goods of this world must perish,
do not lust after anything that will bring punishment on your
body and retribution on your soul. Desire rather those things
whose fruit is an everlasting joy.

(58) Doing good is born of zeal, <zeal> of prayer(?), prayer
of desire, desire of intellect, intellect of knowledge of the
other world; and knowledge (of the other world) is a weapon that
was and is and (evermore) shall be. By it He is known Who creates
all things anew, Who teaches (all) things, Who ordains all that
should be done Who wills the good (sut) of all in this world and
the next.'

EH

Whosoever is in the world must perform the office a certain number of times and must know what sins he is liable to commit with hand or foot,
— unless he be deaf or dumb: in that case he cannot be accounted guilty. Should a deaf or dumb man perform a religious office, then it should be the erpatastan, and he should know the commentary on it.
