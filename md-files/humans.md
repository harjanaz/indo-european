## Defining a Human

In the IE conception, humans are (among other things):
- (1) Known as "[[earthlings]]". terrestrial. 
- (2) Endowed with life and subject to [[death-decay]]
	- Endowed with  a [[body]]
	- Subject to [[health-medic-sick-ill-pain-disease]].
	- Subject to [[age]]
	- Compelled to [eat food](food-eating.md)
	- Have a finite amount of [[time]] to life our life, to use our lifeforce
	- Called `*n̥k̑u̯o-` or `*mr̥to-` (< `*mer- "die" [109]`) "mortals, dying-ones"

These two main characteristics-- (1)our location/home (terrestrial); and (2) our constitution--are what define us, and **binarily separate us from** the gods. See the page [[humans-vs-gods]] for more on this point.

### Heroes, Warriors, Kings, Princes, etc
On the one hand you can follow [Dumézil](dumezil.md) and make a clear functional distinction: Kings & Princes  (1st) vs Warriors (2nd). But in scholarhship the word "hero" is used vaguely.
