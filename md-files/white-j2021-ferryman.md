## Description
The Ferryman is one of the oldest characters in human history, and his purpose was to take you to the Underworld. So why does he turn up in so many stories and cultures? He has a past that has a huge history, and here we look at some of his myths, and use our understanding of him and his common traits, to see if we can trace him back, back far in time, and probably far longer back than you would first imagine, making him one of the oldest characters in story telling history. And with the information we discover we can start understanding how our ancestors thought of death. So welcome to myths of Odin, the Proto Indo Europeans and their Centum and Satem divisions, and the Persians. We discuss bridges, boats, and psycho-pomps, and how our view of death has changed over time. And welcome to the story of the Ferry man.
