## Misc
[[heliand]]
Norse: Eomen used bracteates to signal pagan affiliation in the face of Christian missions (Wicker).  from The Cross Goes North Ed. Martin Carver

After conversion, Anglo-Saxon women wore objects of Christian instead of pagan symbolism, suggesting to Yorke 'that the custom was considered to be sufficiently important to be adapted to the new religion.' 

• Anglo-Saxon missionaries:
	- "did not emphasize the central soteriological and eschatological aspects of Christianity. Instead, seeking to appeal to the Germanic regard for power, they tended to emphasize the omnipotence of the Christian God and temporal rewards he would bestow upon those who accepted him. (p.23)
	- In Heliand and The Dream of The Rood portrayed Christ as a warrior lord. (p.23-4)

### Other
 
 • In Saxony and near by regions in Germany around 1600:
	○ Most of the people were ignorant of even the most basic Christian concepts and followed soothsayers, cunning women, crystal-gazers, casters of spells, witches, etc. (p.29)

"There is no evidence of a major drive by non-Christian Germanic peoples comparable to that of Emperor Julian to restore or advance pre-Christian Roman religion." (p.38)

Germanic peoples did not bother to object to individual dogmas, because dogmatic orthodoxy was not central to their notion of religion. (p.39)


• Examples of Christian adaptation to the Germans:
	○ The church's support of warfare "Germanic peoples had a clear cense that war was a religious undertaking, in which the gods were interested." "Who shall not say that St. Michael of later days was not Woden under fresh colors?" (p.40) Just look at St. Bernard's De laude novae militiae
	○ According to Jungmann:  (p.42)
		§ private votive Masses commemorating Mary and the saints
		§ the increase in signs of the cross in the Mass
		§ silent prayer with hands folded (derived from the posture of a vassal pledging fealty to his lord
		§ Dramatic and allegorical representations of Christ's life 
		§ Weekly liturgical cycle
		§ Decline in emphasis on the soteriological-eschatological
		§ Christmas festival cycle
		§ Increased stratification of clergy and laity (represented by increased distance between the altar and the faithful and the addition of the communion rail)
	○ According to U.T. Holmes: (p.43)
		§ Germanic Spirituality focused on objects (the cross, real presence in the Eucharist, Blessed Virgin, Scriptures) rather than subtleties of process (growth in perfection, etc)
