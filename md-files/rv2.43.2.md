> Thou like the chanter-priest chantest the Sama, Bird; thou singest at libations like a Brahman's son. Even as a vigorous horse when he comes near the mare, announce to us good forturue, Bird, on every side, proclaim in all directions happy luck, O Bird. [[Griffith]]

> Like the Udgātar, o omen-bird, you sing the sāman. Like the Son of the Sacred Formulation, you recite at the pressings. [[jamison-brereton2014-rigveda]]

> Thou, O bird, singest a sama verse like a udgatri; thou singest praises like the son of a brahman (*brahmaputra*) at the libations"


[[jamison-brereton2014-rigveda]]p462 "The last two brief hymns in Maṇḍala II have a popular character and call on the “omen bird” (śakúni / śakúnti) to produce only auspicious cries. The second of the two (II.43) playfully compares the bird to various priests in the ritual and is thus reminiscent of the famous “Frog Hymn” (VII.103), which identifies the behavior of frogs in the monsoon with that of priests."
