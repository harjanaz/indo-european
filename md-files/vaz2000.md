## Abstract
> This paper aims to show that such apparently disparate themes as “Cinderella” and “The Dragon Slayer” convey nevertheless a unitary semantic constellation. The main methodological contention is that symbolical analysis calls for the abandoning of classificatory assumptions. On theoretical grounds, the present discussion attempts to develop Vladimir Propp’s unheeded insight that all fairy tales derive from a single source.
