> "Etruscan inscriptions and representations in art confirm that **Tinia** (also wirtten as Tin, Tina) is at the head of the Etruscan pantheon. He is a sky god, reffered to as "father" (*apa*), often equated, as noted in Table I, with the Greek **Zeus** and the Roman **Jupitar** (whose name includes the Latin word for father, pater). A close-association between Tinia of the Etruscans and Jupiter of the Romans is confirmed by the fact that the greatest temple of Rome, to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, was built during the period when Etruscan kings, the Tarquins, ruled Rome in the 6th century BCE. The deity type is familiar in Indo-European mythology, and it is tempting to compare Tinia also with **Odin**, the "Allfather" and "Ruler of Weather" of the Norse pantheon [n3:...Odin's name, if transliterated into Etruscan, would be Utin], especially when we consider that Odin stood at the head of a group of gods known as the Aesire, a name that is suprisingly similar to the Etruscan word for the gods as a group, *aiser*. Of course each of these father-weather gods has his own particular nature; in this chapter we shall focus on the characteristics that make Tinia distinctive." (p53)
