### Age (Youths & Elders)
- PIE h2i̯u-Hen- ‘young man’ [278] (probably originally ‘having youthful vigor / life-force’)
- The terms for old man and old woman in PIE (g̑ erh2 -ont- [276], g̑ erh2 -u- ‘old woman’ [277]) are derived from the verbal root g̑erh2- ‘rub, grind, make old’ [252]. "The worn down ones".
