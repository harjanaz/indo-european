## Description
> This Yamnaya warrior was buried in a kurgan (burial mound) on the steppe with this mighty weapon from prehistoric warfare. Is it the mythical weapon of Indra; the cudgel Vajra? What does it have to do with Hercules and Thor? We discuss the mythology of the Striker-Thunderer and talk about Yamnaya burial practices and how this image of the Yamnaya warrior inspired my work. The Indo-European myth of the Striker / Thunderer is seen in the forms of Thor, Herakles, and Indra. He is a thunder god - the sun of the sky father - who strikes with a hammer or an axe or club / cudgel. He makes thunder, sends lightning bolts crashing to earth, and he is a wandering hero who slays the serpent and other monsters. Elements of the Striker / Thunderer merged with the figure of the sky father in the form of Zeus while the heroic deeds and monster slaying elements found expression in his sons Herakles and Perseus. Thor has a short handled hammer while Herakles famously has his wooden club. This deity's name amongst the ancient steppe herders may have been Perkwunos meaning 'the Striker' or 'the Lord of Oaks' because of the way lightning tends to strike oak trees. In the most cosmic version of his myth the god uses his celestial weapon to strike down the monster who is holding back the life giving waters.
