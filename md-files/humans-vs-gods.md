## Humans
As explained on the page [[humans]], we are (among other things): 
- (1) Known as "[[earthlings]]". terrestrial. 
- (2) Endowed with life and subject to [[death-decay]]
	- Endowed with  a [[body]]
	- Subject to [[health-medic-sick-ill-pain-disease]].
	- Subject to [[age]]
	- Compelled to [eat food](food-eating.md)
	- Have a finite amount of [[time]] to life our life, to use our lifeforce
## Gods
As explained on the page [[gods]], they are (among other things): 
- (1) Many gods are celestial, that is, located in the sky/heaven. Often capable of flight.
- (2) All are free from [[death-decay]], which means in turn they are:
	- Endowed with a perfect [[body]]
	- Not subject to [[health-medic-sick-ill-pain-disease]].
	- Not subject to [[age]]
	- Not compelled to [eat food](food-eating.md), or if they do eat food it is nectar/ambrosia/basically-divine-preservative
	-  Have an infinite amount of [[time]] to life their lives, to use their lifeforce
	-  Called  `*n̥-mr̥tōs` "immortal, un-dying" (Grk. *ámbrotoi*, Lat. *dī immortales*, etc.).

## Comparison
- As you can see above, humans and gods have fundamentally opposite homeworlds and constitutions. 
	- Or, when it comes to constitutions, we can say more acurately: `gods' constitution = humans' constitution - death/decay`. The gods are a vision of what we could be if we weren't hampered by [[death-decay]], 
	- The gods are a vision of what we could be if we weren't bound to the soil.
	- The differences are explicit and binary: the use of terms like `*dhg̑hom-i̯o-/-on-` "[earthling](earthlings.md)" and `*n̥-mr̥tōs` "un-dying-ones" bring their contrasting natures to the forefront of the listener's mind; they define by contrasting.

- There are some ironies: 
	- Gods are immortal yet consume special life preserving sustances (nectar, ambrosia, apples, etc)
	- Humans are mortal yet live out an [[afterlife]] in the [[otherworld]] as [[ancestors-the-dead]], can attain eternal [fame](fame-renown-glory-memory-heard-tales.md) through great deeds, and are venerated in death by the living (whether normal people or heroes).
	- Humans are bound to the earth and this world, yet can visit the [[otherworld]] while alive via special means.
