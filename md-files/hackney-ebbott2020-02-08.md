> The relationship between Idomeneus and Meriones fits into an Indo-European mythical paradigm of the hero and his charioteer ([[paradigm-hero-charioteer]]). In such relationships, the charioteer often loses his life, thereby saving the life of his more dominant other half. The concept of the _opaōn_ is similar to that of the _therapōn_ (defined by Gregory Nagy as ‘ritual substitute’), which is what Achilles calls Patroklos in _Iliad_ 16.244. In that passage, Achilles prays that when Patroklos returns to battle he have the power to fight on his own, instead of as part of the closely linked fighting pair that Achilles and Patroklos normally form. Instead, however, Patroklos dies (at the hands of Apollo, Euphorbus, and Hektor), wearing Achilles’ armor and in many ways previewing Achilles’ own death, in some traditions at least, at the hands of Paris and Apollo. (On _opaōn_ and its application to Meriones, we are indebted to an unpublished paper by Ellen Aitken. On the _therapōn_ as a ‘ritual substitute’ for the hero, as Patroklos functions for Achilles, see {[[nagy1979]]:33 & 292–293}. On the relationship between Achilles’ and Patroklos’ death, see also [[burgess1997]].) The night watch seems to be led by younger men in particular, like Meriones here: is there a suggestion that they can better endure the sleeplessness? See further on 10.259 for the association between young men like Meriones and ambush.
