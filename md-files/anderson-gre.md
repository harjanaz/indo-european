Greg Anderson is an Associate Professor of History at Ohio State University, where he has taught since 2005. His teaching and research cover ancient Greece, critical theory, and historical thought. In his first book, The Athenian Experiment: Building an Imagined Political Community in Ancient Attica, 508–490 B.C. (University of Michigan Press, 2003), and a number of other pieces, he questions the use of modern categories such as “state,” “tyranny,” and “democracy” to characterize phenomena in ancient Greek experience. He is currently working on two book projects: a monograph, The Realness of Things Past: Ancient Greece and Ontological History, and a volume of essays on states in history titled State Formations: Histories and Cultures of Statehood, which he is co-editing with John Brooke and Julia Strauss.
