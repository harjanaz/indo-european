## Education
From 2016 to 2020 I attended The Univeristy of Houston where I earned a Double BA Major in Classics (Latin Focus) and Anthropology. I intended to pursue a career in academia and decided to focus my efforts on another ancient Indo-European culture: Vedic India. So, I spent the Summer of 2020 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's SASLI Program studying Sanskrit. I was accepted into The University of Texas' Asian Studies MA program and began attending in the Fall of 2020. For personal reasons I had to cut my MA short and left after the Spring of 2021.
