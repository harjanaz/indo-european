# "Pourer" (of Libations) `PII *zhautar`
Skt. *hótṛ-*
Av. *zaotar-*

- Most important type of Indo-Iranian priest. Their rituals have been preserved for us to a greater extent than that of any other indo-iranian priestly group. The rig veda itself was the manual for hotṛ priests, and Zarathustra himself was a *zaotar* (Y. 33.6)
