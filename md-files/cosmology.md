Things which are [[cosmic-primordial]]

The cosmos has a structure (a cosmography) and a narrative of creation (cosmogony). All of this is cosmology:

- Cosmology
	- [[creation-cosmogony]]
		- Creation of Humans
	- [[cosmos-cosmography]]

- An explaination of something's origin (and often a simultaneous *justification* for it) is [[etiology]]

All of these things can be found in single myths. For example:
ex. The narrative of the first cattle sacrifice is an etiology for mortals, an etiology for sacrifice, a cosmogony, and (in some branches) a cosmography.
