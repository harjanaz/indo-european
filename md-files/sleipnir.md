# Sleipnir

"Sleipnir is the only horse who can ride not only through all the living worlds but into the underworld.  Some modern heathens suggest that Sleipnir is a coffin, with its legs representing the legs of four coffin-bearers.  There is no evidence for this, but it is a notion that implies Odin's ability to ride into an out of the lands of the dead." [1]

"folklore says that the last sheaf of grain harvested should be left in the field to "feed Sleipnir" [1]
