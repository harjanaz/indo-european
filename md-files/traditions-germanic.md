"Thus the Anglo-Saxons lived their lives, cozy in their brightly lit halls, cheered by feasting and music. They placated their gods with sacrifice and strove to keep out the hostile creatures who lurked in the outer darkness. They enjoyed formal ceremonies--pledging of oaths and speechmaking--and superstitious rituals, like the casting of lots, decided the major issues and their lives." -Gale Owen
