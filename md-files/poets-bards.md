## Ultimate Poet
> "[In the *Young Avesta*] Zarathustra's role as first poet-sacrificer is mentioned frequently. [n10: compare {[[kellens1994]]:14n6}. In Greek literature the notion of the divinely inspired "ultimate poet" is seen in the case of both Homer and Hesiod, see {[[nagy1979]]:[5-6](https://chs.harvard.edu/chapter/introduction-a-word-on-assumptions-methods-results/)}: "...the references made by an archaic poem to its composer, or 'author', are not so much a personal attempt by the poet to identify himself but rather a formal reflection of the poetry upon its own importance: the archaic poem presents itself retrospecively as something transmitted by the ultimate poet."]" {[[skjaervo2003]]:161 edited}.
