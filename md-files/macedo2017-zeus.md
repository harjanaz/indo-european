## Abstract
> Zeus' epithets related to his storm-god function may be divided into three main types as far as his weapon, the thunderbolt, is concerned: a frst in which the god throws his weapon from afar (e.g. κεραυνοβόλος), a second in which the god is identified with the thunderbolt (e.g. κεραυνός), and a third in which he is figured riding it as a charioteer (e.g. ἐλασιβρόντας). In what follows I shall briefly discuss the last two categories, including some epithets which might belong in either (e.g. καταιβάτης). Comparative evidence will be presented for both types.
