## Description (Edited)
In this video, I discuss the pluralistic idea of the Saxon soul. All words below can be found throughout the Heliand.

The example of the ferah enclosing the seola is in lines 3350-3353. In this passage, a wretched man's ferah is taken by the angels, and his seola is set in Abraham's bosom, implying that the ferah, departing from the body, encloses the seola. Admittedly, I became more influenced by my decision to say "protect" after I looked at the Old Norse cognates. Nevertheless, I think the example with ferah/seola above could be taken to mean that the ferah is that which houses the seola. But again, all of this is difficult to deal with.
