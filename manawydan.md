# Manawydan
ยง Brother of Branwen and Bran
ยง "He is a cognate of the Irish Manannan, Son of Liir, a sea-god. The marine identity of Manawydan is not developed in the Welsh myth, but the two share common features, such as the ability to conjure magic and a reputation for trickery."
ยง "He is a magician, a trickster, a superb craftsman. Moreover, his cultivation of wheat may constitute a mythical explanation of the introduction of arable exploitation in Wales."
