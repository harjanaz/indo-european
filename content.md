[[home]]

## Currently
The site's content pages are organized according to:
- Hitorical [[branches]]; [[history]] (archaeology, genetics, etc.)
- [[languages]] (includes [[texts]] and ancient [[persons]])
- [[cultures]] (includes [[folk]] beliefs and [[religion]])
- [[narratives]]

## In the Future
I will transition to using [[buck1949]]'s semantic fields as foundation to organize topics.
