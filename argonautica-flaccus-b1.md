# Argonautica by Flaccus b1 (trans.)

> Those straits the mighty sons of the gods first sailed, we sing,    1
> 
> and their sacred ship that dared the banks of Scythia's Phasis,
> 
> braving Symplegades' rocks that clashed together, and sank
> 
> and settled to rest at last in the depths of the starry sky.    4
