## Abstract
In the discussion on myth-rite relations, the concept of metamorphosis occupies a significant place. The abundance of shape changings in myths and folktales leads to the hypothesis that they echo practices of initiation rites. This paper attempts to analyze the motif of transformations flight as found in myths and folktales and its connection with rites of passage. On a mythical level, the most common example of transformations flight is between a reluctant goddess or nymph and a god as seducer, best illustrated by the myth of Zeus and Nemesis. On a folklore level, the motif of transformations flight could show traces of a rite of initiation; special attention is given to Romanian folktales.
