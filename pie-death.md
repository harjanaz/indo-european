- The Dead Without Status by Juha Pentikäinen in Nordic Folklore: Recent Studies
"...those whose admission to the community of the departed has, for one reason or another, been denied...remain[ing] in a permanent transition phase...the Catholic concept of Purgatory. [The] Finish...tradition embraces a similar concept, sijattomat sielut (placeless souls), which refers to those among the departed who are restless. In [the] German tradition they are called arme Seelen (poor souls). 
"The following belief is found all over Finland: "If you die a bad death, you will haunt"

	• Ship Funeral
		○ Women burned with their husbands
		○ Sign of the Hammer
		○ Sacrifice of horses
		○ "Then the body of Balder was carried out on to the ship, and when his wide Nanna, the daughter of Nepr, saw this, her heart broke with grief and she died; she was carried to the pyre and laid in the flames. Thor stood beside the pyre and hallowed it with Mjollnir...Balder's horse was led to the pyre in all its trappings."
		○ Oseberg: 
			§ A royal barge was buried under a mound with the bodies of two women
			§ A wooden Freyr's wagon
