CAULDRONS
The Cauldron of Rebirth

The bruidhen hostel was furnished with an ever-replenishing cauldron

The Cauldron is associated with the Daghda

[The Welsh tale of Branwen] Bendigeidfran's Irish magic cauldron: can restore warriors to life, if they are cooked in it overnight. The soldiers rise again as strong as before, but they have lost the power of speech, a sure sign that they are still dead. This regenerative potency is paralleled by the healing well of the Irish divine leech, Dian Cécht, who restores dead warriors to life by immersing them in the water and chanting incantations over them. Interestingly on of the inner plates of the Gundestrup Cauldron perhaps displays the ressurective properties of cauldrons: it shows a large supernatural figure with a group of Celtic soldiers, one of whom the god is either dipping into or removing from a large vat of liquid.

cauldron and water-ritual

ceremonial cauldrons of sheet-bronze were used as early as the Bronze Age. In the Iron Age many great cult cauldrons are recorded: the vessels of Llyn Fawr and Llyn Cerrig in Wales; Brå, Rynkeby and Gundestrup Denmark; Duchcov Czechoslovakia were all associated with lakes and springs.

An interesting aspect of Celtic perceptions about death and rebirth, associated with blood, is expressed in the imagery of the divine hunt , which is present in many of the myths. Since hunting required bloodshed in order to provide nourishment, the act of hunting acquired the symbolism of resurrection, and the interdependent dualism which exists between life and death. The wine-symbolism of the Burgundian iconography may likewise by linked with blood, death and rebirth.

certain creatures are particularly symbolic of renewal: the snake was a potent image of rebirth....Birds, with their power to leave earth in flight, naturally became identified with the perception of the spirit rising free from the body at death, an idea which persisted into medieval Christian symbolism. Otherworld deities are often associated with birds: the Irish Clíodna had three magical bird which could heal with their song; the three singing birds of Rhiannon, alluded to in the Mabinogi, express the same perception of birds that symbolize life and death. Stags possessed regenerative imagery, probably because of the seasonal shedding and regrowth of their antlers, which evoked the symbolism of autumn and spring.

Trees were important symbols of rebirth. Deciduous trees apparently died in winter, their bare branches silhouetted against the sky like the bones of a skeleton, but in spring they were born again, producing new leaves and then fruit. Trees were also seen as a link between life and death, the upper and lower worlds 

Apples trees feature in otherworld myths. Clíodna's birds eat fruit from the sacred apple tree; in the voyage of Bran the symbol of the Otherworld goddess is an apple branch, silver with white blossom. The Happy Otherworld of Arthurian Romance is Avalon, the Paradise of Apple Trees, a magical island in the West.
