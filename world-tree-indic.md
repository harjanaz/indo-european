[[world-tree]]

---

- *Ficus religiosa*, native to India & SE Asia
- Called the asvattha/peepul/sacred-fig tree
- It may be connected to the Kalpa-vṛkṣa or wish-fulfilling tree that the Bhagavata Purana uses as a metaphor for itself. 
- Buddha achieved enlightenment under it (hence it is also called the Bodhi "wisdom" tree)
- Identified with Brahman
- Like the Nyagrodha or Banyan tree, the Asvattha can have aerial roots, that is, roots above ground level, which seems to have some symbolic significance.
