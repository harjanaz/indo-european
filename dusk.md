## PIE Dusk Goddess
- PIE while ‘evening’ and ‘west’ [368] derive from *u̯ esp- ‘enshroud, clothe’ [369] (cf. Katz 2000). [[klein-et2017-20]]
- There may have been another goddess, that of Dusk, perhaps [Dawn's](dawn-sunrise) sister.
- Among the Slavs and the Vedics there was a goddess associated with the evening twilight as well. The Vedic Rātrī, Night, is the sister of U?as (Macdonell, 1897 (1974) 124); together they nurse Rātrī’s son, Agni (RV 1.96.5). The Slavs had two goddesses with the same name, the Zoryas (Zaroff, 1999, 54). This doesn’t seem to have been the Proto-Indo-European pattern, however, with the dawn and dusk pattern being filled by the Diwós Sunú.
