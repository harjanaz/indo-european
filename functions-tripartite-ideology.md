First theorized by [[dumezil]] and later built on by others.

A hierarchically ranked, strata; functionally differentiated; Functionally integrated strata of men and gods; both mythic/divine/immortal and social/class/caste/human/mortal; Gods:Society The Gods represent social class, they are a "collective representation".
  
  Dumezil uses the word "function" not in the "functionalist" sense, but in the mathematical one. In (c-littleton 1973p5)'s words: "I-E ideology...is the sum of three fundamental classificatory principles--sovereignty, force, and nourishment--each of which is, in the mathematical sense, a function of the others. Together they form a functionally integrated whole, '*le système, implicite ou explicite*'...the term 'function'...refers...to neither the social strata, the behavior of their occupants, nor their divine representations. Rather, it refers to the principles in terms of which thes phenomena are defined. The labels 'first,' 'second,' and 'third' refer to the hierarchical order in which these principles usually manifest themselves. "
