> **Description**
> The history and stories of the people, places, gods, and culture from the Neolithic to the early Middle Ages. Named after a town mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, a place where I grew up. We'll cover Old Norse and Vikings, heathenry, the many and various pagan religions, the Abrahamic religions such as Christianity (Xtians), Judaism and Islam. And also the proto-indo Europeans, the people who provide a common link between all of these.

### PIE Series
> People are aware of the religions across Eurasia, and some are aware of the proto-Indo-Europeans, but how do we know if they were linked. This is the journey into how we discovered how religions evolved, and where most of the world's religions now come from.
