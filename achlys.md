> Arise mother of misery
Arise as divine sorrow
I offer up all I am
So that you may feast on me
Pass through me like dark light
Make my burden yours
Let this pass from me
Daughter of the dark
Dance with me to the sound of Godâ€™s infinite silence
And when the sun rises again
I will be made new
Safe from your touch
From your poison thoughts
And your heart breaking power
If I could see the sun
Just one last time
I would be made new
