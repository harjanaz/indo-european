# PIE Clothing

[(e-barber1975)]((e-barber1975).md) speculated on Proto-Indo-European clothing by comparing the folk costumes of the descendant traditions. Her suggested reconstructed clothing was made from wool, linen, nettle, or hemp. The main garment was a tunic, knee length for men, and frequently longer for women, with a cord worn around it as a belt. Over the tunic was another garment, sometimes smaller, made of a stiffer material such as felt. It was often decorated, and is the ancestor of the embroidered vests of eastern Europe. Women wore hats with a mantle, sometimes held on with a diadem. Later Indo-Europeans, possibly still within the Proto-Indo-European period, wore pants or kilts with their tunics. There is no evidence regarding footwear.
