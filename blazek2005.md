## Abstract
> The purpose of the present study is to analyze the mutual relationsof the Fenno-Ugric and Indo-Iranian in the mythological lexicon. Re-garding the phonetic, dialectological, geographical and chronological circumstances, at least three Indo-Iranian strata can be determined inFenno-Ugric: Indo-Iranian or Indo-Aryan (usually unrecognizable),early Iranian and late (Middle) Iranian. In contrary to the usual prac-tice admitting only the oneway vector of borrowing from Indo-Iranianinto Fenno-Ugric, a witness for the opposite direction from Fenno-Ugric into both Indo-Aryan and Iranian is also presented here.
