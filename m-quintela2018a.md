## Abstract
The dualism of the Celtic calendar is identified in the Coligny calendar and in the Irish traditional calendar. On this basis, we wonder about the existence of a spatial correlation of this organization of time. Moreover, Greek, and Roman cosmogonic conceptions express the solidarity between time and space. The text prolongs studies on Lugdunum and other places where the vitality of the Celtic tradition is expressed by offering a synthetic version of works on seven sites in present-day Galicia and another three in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula under Celtic influence. It shows how the use of local topographies by Iron Age settlers, revealed by archaeological remains, indicates the implementation of a dualistic symbolic mechanism of apprehension of the communitarian landscapes continued, in some cases, under Christianity. Thus, the correlation of Celtic dualistic conceptions of time and space and their solidarity in creating the physical frameworks of social life from a cosmological discourse of mythical and ritual foundation is shown.
