# README

Howdy! Welcome to The Indo-European Wiki. It was started by [dodge](dodge.md) and contains over 5000 pages as of Sep 23rd 2021. If you would like to contribute:

1. Make a Github account. I will then add you as a contributor to the repository.
2. Once I've added you, you can go to the repo page <https://github.com/harjanaz/indo-european-wiki> and press the "." key on your keyboard. It will open up a cloud editor (VS Code).
3. Because the editor doesn't natively support [[wiki style links]] you'll need to click the extension button on the left hand side and install the "WikiLens" extension.
4. Edit away!
5. When you're done editing click the fork symbol on the left hand side. Describe briefly what you changed (ex. "added some references" or "cleaned up a page"). Then click the checkmark. It'll push your changes to the main repo.
