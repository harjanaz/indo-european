# README

Howdy! Welcome to The Indo-European Wiki. It was started by [dodge](dodge) and contains over 5000 pages as of Sep 23rd 2021. If you would like to contribute:

1. Make a Github account. I will add you as a contributor to the repository.
2. Go to the repo page <https://github.com/harjanaz/indo-european-wiki> and press the "." key on your keyboard. It was open up a cloud editor (VS Code).
3. Because VS Code doesn't natively support [[wiki style links]] you'll need to click the extension button on the left hand side. Install the "WikiLens" extension.
4. Edit away!
5. When you're done editing click the fork symbol on the left hand side. Describe briefly what you change (ex. "added some references" or "clean up a page"). Then click the checkmark. It'll push your change to the main repo.
