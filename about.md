Back in 2018, while attending the University of Houston for my BA, I  was introduced to Indo-European Studies by my classics professor, [Casey Du√© Hackney](c-hackney.md), who had studied under [Gregory Nagy](nagy-g.md).  The idea that we could reveal an undiscovered past through the comparative method excited me so much I've been spending the past two years hoarding scholarship like a [dragon](serpent-dragon-worms-eels-snakes) hoards gold.

As I began researching, I noticed that there was a serious divide between IE Linguists and "cultural" PIE Scholars, as well as a divide between scholars in general and the lay public: 
- Many IE Linguists are unaware of the *sheer amount* of cultural reconstruction that has been done on the Proto-Indo-Europeans. This Garden was created in part to show scholars the wonders their colleagues have discovered. M. L. West and Mallory are just the start, two centuries of scholarship awaits you.

- Lay people don't know where to look for solid information and scholars are almost universally unaware of the growing religious movement which could be termed "[Indo-European Spirituality](pagans.md)". For many polytheists Indo-European studies isn't just research, it's a means of dialogue between various branches of reconstructionist polytheism (Norse, Roman, Slavic, Greek, etc). Guided by my [background in Classics and Anthropology](dodge.md) I aim to gather in one place both hard scholarship and anthropological information on modern polytheism. 

Everything from books, articles, presentations, talks, blog posts, comments on hypothe.is, comments on facebook, comments on reddit, devotional websites, memes, to long forgotten works dragged out of dusty library basements will be included. Everything is separated, organized by topic, and most importantly: untouched by me. **I am an academic curator, not a blogger or guru**. Facts, references, and summaries are what rule here, not opinion. **When modern spiritual views are included, they will be treated as an anthropological New Religious Movement and designated under a separate header.**

Given the amount of material, many of the entries are rough. In time however, this will be the #1 site for cultural PIE topics. If you are interested in helping develop it please [contact me](dodge.md#Contact).

The site also contains many pages on a variety of ancient topics: Zoroastrian conversion, Turkic folklore, you name it. 

This site is written in markdown and hosted by [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). There are very few sites that combine Digital Humanities and Indo-European Studies. One phenomenal exception is the website for [[bjorn2017]].

It's written in Markdown using ObsidianMD and is organized as a kind of [Digital Garden](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c-scale,w-1600/v1593765637/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/digital-garden.png). 

It fits in with other sites like the [Bibliographia Iranica](https://www.biblioiranica.info/) and UT's [Linguistics Research Center](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/lrc/).
