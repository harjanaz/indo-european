# Sun, Sky, Fire, Etc.

- "The pagan Celts perceived numinosity (the presence of spirits) in all aspects of the natural world."

- "of all natural phenomena, the sun was especially invoked as a life-force, as a promoter of fertility and healing and as a comfort to the dead."

- "In Ireland the eponymous goddess Ériu possibly possesed a solar function...In a myth which grew up around the enactment of inaugural ritua, the sun is perceived as a golden cup full of red liquor (perhaps wine)borne by Eriu and handed to successive mortal kings of Ireland to legitami
  
  - "This myth is interesting for two reasons: first because the sun is associated with a goddess, in contrast to most sun-cults which are represented almost exclusively by male deities. in the pagan Celtic tradition...there is a solar goddess, represented by clay figurines, whose body is marked with sun-symbols. The second significant point concerns the Insular association between the sun and fecundity."

- The veneration of the sun may be concerned with heat, light, or both. If the light-element is emphasized, it may be difficult to distinguish between the sun and the sky as a source of cult. The Irish god Lugh ('Shining One') is clearly associated with brilliant light; he may or may not have been a sun god, but his role as a divine young warrior, conqueror of evil, has its parallel in some of the pagan iconography considered below."

- [Figure] "Bronzy, France."

- "Lleu Llaw Gyyes. His name means 'Bright One of the Skillful Hand', and ay be cognate with Lugh...When struck by the spear of his wife Blodeuwedd's lover, Lleu changes into an eagle and flies into an oak tree. In pagan Romano-Celtic symbolism both the eagle and the oak were closely linked with the cult of the sky-god...

- "From as early as the middle of the Bronz

- Warriors wore solar amulets as protection against harm in battle; people were buried in tombs accompanied by miniature sun-symbols, as if to luminate their dark journey to the Otherworld. Worshippers offered model wheels in such shrines as that at Alesia in Burgundy, and cast them into rivers, such as the Seine, Oise and Marne, as votive offerings."

- "The Romano-Celtic...solar religion...is...a multi-faceted, complex cult, the powers of the sun being perceived as having many functions and concerns."

- "late Iron Age depiction of a wheel-god on the Danish Gundestrup Cauldron, which dates to the second-first century BC."

- "The most prominent Romano-Celtic iconography represents the solar wheel god as conflated, to an extent, with the imagery of the Roman sky-god Jupiter. A statuette...from Landou

- "the association between the sun and war, noted in the Iron Age, continues in the Romano-Celtic phase, when a distinctive group of images displays the solar/sky-god in battle against the forces of darkness and evil....'Jupiter-Giant columns'...Although the iconography of the victor riding down the foe may have its origins in Roman art, the images on the summit of these columns nonetheless depict a Celtic religious tradition, where the god of light and life is mounted on horseback, brandishing his protective solar wheel like a shield and his thunderbolt as a weapon, riding down the chthonic forces personified as a snake-limbed giant. [This association is also seen in] The north British war-god Belatucadrus has a name meaning 'Fair Shining One'; the Gaulish Mars Loucetius, invoked with his consort Nemetona at Bath, also bears a surname evocative of light."

- Horses
  
  - "Horses were closely linked to the solar cult. They were envisaged as animals of sufficient speed and prestige to carry the sky-god into battle...In many Indo-European sun myths, the solar disc was perceived as being carried across the sky in a chariot pulled by a horse-team. The chariot of the Greek god Apollo was the prototype for the reverse of many Celtic coins: Celtic artistry frequently reduced the image to a single horse, a chariot-wheel and a great spoked solar disc in the sky.

- Healing and Fertility
  
  - "The solar properties of heat and light gave rise to cults associated with the curing of disease and the promotion of abundance. Miniature sun-wheels were cast into curative springs;

- "the goddess who presided over the great healing sanctuary at Bath was Sulis, a solar name.

- "The Celtic Apollo was a deity of light and healing who was equated with a number of local gods and presided over many therapeutic spring shrines. Thus Apollo Belenus ('Bright' or 'Brilliant One') was venerated at such curative shrines as Sainte Sabine in Burgundy but also far away in Noricum (Austria). The name Belenus may have philological links with Beltene, the great Insular 1 May festival at which bonfires were lit in celebration of summer and as a purification rite to protect livestock from disease. Apollo Vindonnus, worshipped at Essarois in Burgundy, had a Celtic surname indicative of pure, clear light. It is significant that his cult was especially concerned with the curing of eye-afflictions. One the pediment of his temple was an image of Vindonnus as a radiate sun-god."

- "The Celtic mother-goddesses were sometimes associated with the solar cult. Little clay figurines of goddesses from central Gaul and Brittany were depicted with solar symbols on their bodies. At Netherby in Cumbria and Naix in northern Gaul a deity is represented with a solar wheel and a cornucopia"

- Fire 
  
  - "The great fire festivals of Celtic Europe took place in acknowledgement of fire as the terrestrial counterpart of the sun in the sky. Like the sun, fire both gives and destroys life. Fire is a cleanser, a purifier, and from ashes springs new, fertile vegetation. The fire-ceremonies were a form of sympathetic magic, enacted to persuade the sun to return after its winter desertion. Beltene on 1 May, Lughnasad on 1 August and Samhain as the end of the Celtic year (1 November) all celebrated critical times in the annual cycle. The Christian midsummer festival which marked the birth of St. John the Baptist derived directly from much earlier ceremonies. Both pagan and Christian festivals involved rolling a flaming wooden wheel down a hillside to a river. The Christian Saint Vincent observed a ceremony in fourth-century Aquitaine where a wheel was set alight, rolled to a river and then reassembled in the temple of the sky-god. A Saint John's festival, noted as being celebrated as late as the nineteenth century, records the rolling of a great, flaming, straw-covered wheel down the Stromberg Mountain to the River Moselle. If it reached the water unimpeded and without being quenched, a good wine-harvest was predicted."

- The Sun and Death  
  
  - "The...power of the sun was perceived to penetrate the dark, [chthonic] regions...At the Dürrnberg in Austria, a...young girl...was interred with a miniature bronze wheel-symbol...in Romano-Celtic Alsace...tombstones were carved with solar designs which...may reflect the hope of rebirth in a happy Otherworld."  


       

- Cult Liturgy  
  
  - "The temple at Wanborough in Surrey produced two chain headdresses surmounted by wheel-symbols, perhaps worn by priests of the sun-cult. The bronze mace from Willingham Fen (Cambridgeshire) with its depiction of the wheel-god also suggests ceremonial activity. Shrines, like that of Alesia in Burgundy, with its numerous model wheels, may have been consecrated to the sun -god."  

- Theology  
  
  - "The sculptures of the Jupiter-columns hint at a dualistic, seasonal myth, where forces of day and night, light and darkness, life and death are balanced in an endless power struggle. The Willingham scepter, with its figures of sun-god, three-horned bull, eagle, dolphin and infernal monster, exhibit a complexity which...argues for the presence of myth....material evidence shows...concerns of...life, healing, fertility and the mysteries of death and rebirth.
