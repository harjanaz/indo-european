## Description
Creation Myths often have twin figures, Yemo, Tuisto, Apsu and Tiamat, even Adam and Eve, the first couple in the bible, part of the Abrahamic creation myth, and in Indo-European traditions there are couples too, they can be found in the Old Norse Askr and Embla, the Vedic Yama and Yamĩ, and the Iranian Mašya and Mašyānag. These couples are made from trees or rocks, bones or dragon teeth, or similar items that were lying around when the god or gods decided to make them. But the human origin myth in Roman, Germanic, and Indo-Iranian sources suggests a much more complex story behind these couples, in effect suggesting their origins maybe as twins. In this video I look at the proto indo european twins of creation, from Ymir to Yemo, and Purusa to Tuisto, to discover who is the twin of whom, and perhaps find out that a twin pairing is not as simple as it appears, and a very recent version of the myth. A significant amount of the detail here comes from Jaan Puhvel's Comparative Mythology book, and specifically his chapter on Twins.
